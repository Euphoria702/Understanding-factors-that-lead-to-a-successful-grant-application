SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size:


1,800,000 ARB maximum


Grant Matching:


N/A


Grant Breakdown:


This grant targets the importation of 100,000,000 USDC to the Arbitrum economy. Rewards target an ~5-8% annualized rate of reward for users that utilize 
Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol
 (CCTP) through Wormhole and its partners to mint native USDC on Arbitrum.


~5-8% is chosen because it is competitive to real-world and DeFi alternatives such as Coinbase USDC rewards and the DAI Savings Rate at MakerDAO, while still reflecting the relatively low level of risk to users.


This reward is meant to be available for a maximum of 3 months, and accrue weekly. That translates into a maximum 2% total return for users over the course of 3 months. At the time of writing, 1.8m ARB is required to provide that for 100m USDC.


Users that utilize Wormhole and its partners to mint USDC with the CCTP and hold their USDC will be eligible for ~5- 8% rate of return, with reward accruing every 7 days. This reward period will span 12 weeks (approximately 3 months). Users will be free to move their USDC if they choose, but only USDC held in their bridged address will be eligible to accrue rewards as a mechanism to prevent abuse of the bridging subsidy.


At the end of the 12-week rewards period, unaccrued ARB rewards will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO Treasury address (0xf3fc178157fb3c87548baa86f9d24ba38e649b58). Note that users may choose not to claim their ARB rewards within the 12-week window for various reasons, and that accrued rewards will remain in the distribution contract for at least 365 days, at which point the unused portion will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO Treasury address.


Funding Address:


0x101A6a3049F9CDFC4C289A9A0A0E38449AdB8327


Funding Address Characteristics:


This is a 2/3 multisig with private keys securely stored.


Contract Address:


To be determined.


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives:


The objective is to onboard 100,000,000 natively issued USDC from other chains.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):


The single goal of this grant plan is to incentivize 100,000,000 USDC to migrate to Arbitrum from competing ecosystems over a 12-week period, and should be judged on whether that goal is met.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


This grant allows for targeting USDC users in other ecosystems to migrate their assets to Arbitrum. Alternatively, it also provides an incentive for users holding USDC.e to bridge back to Ethereum and re-enter Arbitrum with native USDC, which will speed up the migration from one asset to the other and shorten the period of liquidity fragmentation between the two versions of USDC.


Justification for the size of the grant:


This grant targets the importation of 100,000,000 USDC to the Arbitrum economy. Rewards target an ~5-8% annualized rate of reward for users that utilize CCTP through Wormhole and its partners to mint native USDC on Arbitrum. This reward is meant to be available for a maximum of 3 months, and accrue weekly. That translates into a maximum 2% total return for users over the course of 3 months. At the time of writing, ~1.8m ARB is required to provide that for 100m USDC.


Execution Strategy:


Wormhole will track USDC minted onto Arbitrum via Circle’s CCTP. Addresses where the USDC remains in the minting address on Arbitrum will be eligible for rewards. A distribution contract will be updated weekly with ARB token rewards, and the allowance for each address.


Grant Timeline:


From time of first tranche receipt, estimated timeline:




Announcement of rewards program and building awareness: 2 weeks


Build, test, deploy rewards contract & UI: 1 week (concurrent with above bullet point)


Incentive period: 12 weeks


Prepare report on grant plan results: 4 weeks (requires 30 days’ data post grant)




If this proposal is greater than 1M ARB, please provide details on any funding tranches or milestones your application aims to abide by:

SECTION 5: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Provide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:


Wormhole has integrated 29 different blockchains, including Arbitrum


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?:


A full list of the 29 chains integrated by Wormhole can be found here
.


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?:


Wormhole deployed to Arbitrum 
in July 2022
.


Protocol Performance:


The Circle Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol has 
successfully bridged more than 130 million USDC to Ethereum alone.
 Avalanche, which already hosts a smaller concentration of native USDC than Arbitrum, has successfully bridged more than 50 million USDC, suggesting that 100 million for Arbitrum should be possible given the larger ecosystem and incentives.


Wormhole (and its token bridge, Portal) is a top 10 cross-chain transfer/messaging protocol
. It also was one of only two bridges to receive a passing grade in the 
Uniswap Bridge Report
, and is trusted by Uniswap governance to provide cross-chain governance messaging.


Protocol Roadmap:


Wormhole’s strong solution to the
 bridging trilemma
 earned it the top spot in the Uniswap Foundations Bridge Assessment Report. However, Wormhole is continuously looking to improve its trust assumptions and looking to ZK as an additional security measure atop a validator set. Tentatively, the Wormhole ZK roadmap expects the first live production milestone for light clients in Q1 2024.


Audit History:


Wormhole has had numerous audits and boasts a large bug bounty. 
For full information, please find that here.


SECTION 6: Data and Reporting


Provide details on how your team is equipped to provide data and reporting on grant distribution.


Is your team prepared to create Dune Dashboards according to program requirements for your incentive program?:


Yes, or a publicly available equivalent.


If not, how does your team plan to report grant data?:


A Dune dashboard is likely to be how information is publicly reported."

SECTION 1: APPLICANT INFORMATION


Provide personal or organizational details, including applicant name, contact information, and any associated organization. This information ensures proper identification and communication throughout the grant process.


Applicant Name
: HWxFrank


Project Name
: Rodeo Finance


Project Description
: Rodeo is a decentralized finance protocol that allows its community to earn yield on a range of managed and passive investment strategies on Arbitrum.


At its core, Rodeo has two sides: passive liquidity providers (lenders) earning high, yet safe APR by providing single assets for use by leverage farmers, and leverage farmers who borrow up to 10x to farm real yield strategies. Thus, the protocol enables users to take undercollateralized borrows to increase their positions in vaults and/or yield farming strategies, resulting in higher returns for both active yield seekers as well as passive lenders.


Rodeo’s vision is to become Arbitrum’s leverage hub for maximizing yield. Enabling users and protocols to become more capital efficient, generate higher yields, and onboard the next generation of DeFi users through a simplified, composable solution

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size
: 250,000 ARB


(with a request for an additional 250,000 ARB if the Rodeo TVL increases by 3x to $9m prior to Jan 31 2024. The extended ARB would be utilized in the same breakdown noted below on a 3month timescale from receipt)


Grant Matching
: Rodeo will combine the grant incentives on top of our existing RDO incentive program 
Rodeo Booster (rbLP) Incentives. How To Boost your Incentive Rewards by… | by Rodeo Finance #getleverage | Sep, 2023 | Medium


Grant Breakdown
: The grant’s primary aim is to attract liquidity to Rodeo earn pool and leverage farms. Increasing TVL in Rodeo directly correlates to increased liquidity for underlying Arbitrum protocols on which Rodeo leverage farms are built, while simultaneously generating higher fees for Rodeo’s sustainability and growth. Through the implementation of incentivized yield strategies, we strategically attract users in pursuit of enhanced yield opportunities across various blockchain networks, thereby augmenting the liquidity pool within the Arbitrum ecosystem


The grant will be used for:






30% (75,000 ARB) for Incentivizing Passive Lending: This portion of the grant incentivizes passive lending to bootstrap liquidity for leverage farmers, enabling them to borrow and earn higher yields, ultimately depositing funds into Arbitrum ecosystem protocols.






70% (175,000 ARB) for Leverage Farming and Yield Strategies: Rodeo’s leverage farms allow users to borrow up to 10x their collateral and deposit into yield strategies. The collateral and leveraged funds are swapped for the underlying Arbitrum protocol tokens by Rodeo. By incentivizing leverage farming with a greater weight than the passive lending which is already being incentivized by native RDO, users can access higher yields, protocols can achieve greater TVL through increased liquidity, and Rodeo can generate more fees to continue the mutual flywheel

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives
: The grant’s primary goal is to attract liquidity to high quality projects across the Arbitrum Ecosystem. Boosting these incentives will drive more capital to Arbitrum, and result in deeper liquidity for projects trying to build, and fees created for Rodeo. Users receive better capital efficiency, while protocols receive deeper liquidity, driving a more efficient capital market on Arbitrum.


The core value of Rodeo Finance lies in its ability to seamlessly blend leverage yield farming and passive lending, while maintaining a high level of composability. This combination allows users to optimize their real yields, while driving liquidity (and thus fees) to our partner protocols. By presenting this experience in a simple manner, Rodeo is able to onboard new users from a single UI/UX to participate across multiple Arbitrum protocols


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
: Protocol Metrics




The total amount of assets (TVL) secured in our smart contracts.


The number of unique users holding Rodeo Positions


The number of unique lenders providing USDC on the platform


The number of total leverage positions open


The total amount of assets (TVL) in the lending pool


Lending Utilization rate


TVL per underlying Farm strategy




Each metric shall be tracked at minimum




Starting value


Current value


Immediately upon conclusion of incentive program




Rodeo shall track these metrics on a public analytics page via the Rodeo dApp or via a Dune dashboard


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
: We believe that providing grant funding to Rodeo will yield significant benefits for the Arbitrum ecosystem. The grant incentives we offer will attract additional liquidity, which, in turn, will be strategically channeled into the Arbitrum ecosystem through our leverage farms. This infusion of liquidity will have a cascading impact:






Enhanced Yield Opportunities: By directing these incentives into our leverage farms, we aim to create higher yield opportunities for users. These opportunities will be structured to optimize returns while managing risk effectively, thereby benefiting both experienced and novice users within the Arbitrum ecosystem.






Increased Liquidity and Protocol Fees: The influx of liquidity will not only benefit Rodeo but also bolster the liquidity of Arbitrum’s protocols. As a result, Arbitrum protocols will experience greater transaction volume, resulting in increased fees and rewards for protocols and participants.






Sustainable Rodeo Growth: For Rodeo, the grant will play a pivotal role in sustaining and expanding our offerings. It will enable us to continue providing the most competitive yield-earning opportunities on Arbitrum, ensuring that we can continue to expand and innovate our products securely.






As a native Arbitrum protocol, we align ourselves with the core values of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Our vision is to serve as a unified gateway where the next generation of users can seamlessly access protocols and yield-earning opportunities available across Arbitrum. We are committed to simplifying the user experience, making it accessible to a wider audience, and contributing to the growth and maturation of the Arbitrum network.


Justification for the size of the grant
: A grant for Rodeo is not just an investment in one protocol; it’s an investment in all integrated partners on Rodeo from the Arbitrum ecosystem. Every additional dollar attracted by the grant incentives gets channeled for use directly into our leverage farm partner protocols. With significant grant support, Rodeo is fully committed to using the full grant incentives for driving expansion in the Arbitrum ecosystem


Additionally, will use the grant to provide incentives for TVL to come from other chains.


We will do this using an innovative new product, whereby users can stake LSDs, such as stETH, and get leverage on it. This allows users to keep their precious LSDs (maintaining exposure to staking yield), while levering up against them and getting additional yield in the Arbitrum ecosystem.


Notably, this new product “Alamo” encourages LSD liquidity and other yield bearing assets to move to Arbitrum from Ethereum and other L2s.


Execution Strategy
: Rodeo’s execution strategy focuses on the 2 key areas of the protocol:






Incentivizing Passive Lending (30%): This portion of the grant incentivizes passive lending to bootstrap liquidity for leverage farmers, enabling them to borrow and earn higher yields, ultimately depositing funds into Arbitrum ecosystem protocols.


Incentives will be proportionally allocated for users who lock liquidity in Rodeos lending pool






Leverage Farming and Yield Strategies (70%): Rodeo’s leverage farms allow users to borrow up to 10x their collateral and deposit into yield strategies. The collateral and leveraged funds are swapped for the underlying Arbitrum protocol tokens by Rodeo thus providing a positive sum net benefit in the Arbitrum ecosystem.


Specific focus will be given to the ARB asset leverage farms (ARB/ETH on Camelot and ARB/ETH on Pendle) and farms with highest benefit to the Arbitrum ecosystem.


Incentives will be proportionally allocated for users who farm in the specific leverage farms boosted by incentives. Each farm will be weighted by TVL for incentive distribution and evaluated along the bi-weekly streaming period






Funds will be held and distributed from the Rodeo ⅔ multisig and Rodeo deployer contract


Grant Timeline
: We propose to receive the grant immediately following the conclusion of our full scope Security audit from Paladin (Audit started Sept 25, 2023) and run incentives over a 3 month period from the time of receipt.


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?
 Yes


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS

For full transparency: Rodeo experienced 2 exploits in the past on unreleased farms as noted on the Defillama dashboard. The exploited funds were not recovered, however Rodeo has been repaying all bad debt from the Rodeo treasury to ensure no user funds are impacted by the events, with full repayment to conclude with Paladin audit completion.


As mitigation to the exploits, Rodeo significantly increased security by working with several well known individuals and security firms to independently review the code base and make any noted mitigations per their suggestions. We have undergone Audit 
#2
 and 
#3
 noted below in the audit history and are currently in the process of another full scope audit (Audit 
#4
) from Paladin before increasing cap limits on farms/lending pool and releasing new farms + leverage products

Protocol Roadmap
: Rodeo Finance is expanding the yield earning opportunities for users and integrations with underlying Arbitrum Protocols as part of our long term vision and roadmap goals


Q3-Q4 2023:






New Farms: By creating a compelling incentive program for liquidity providers, Rodeo finance can attract additional market share to Arbitrum and liquidity to Arbitrum protocols. We’ve identified a number of compelling sectors & protocols we plan to onboard as leverage farms in Q4 of 2023:




GMX V2 GM Pools


Umami Finance Deconstructed GLP Vaults


Aura Finance Pools


Vela (VLP) / HMX (HLP)


Uniswap/Camelot V3 Concentrated LP








Yield bearing Token Leverage Product V1: Rodeo has recognized a substantial opportunity within the DeFi space, with the total value locked (TVL) in liquid staking tokens exceeding $19 billion and Yield bearing tokens representing another large market share. We will be introducing a product that allows users to maintain exposure to LSTs / yield bearing tokens (examples could be wstETH, jUSDC, GLP, etc) while simultaneously harnessing the yield opportunities offered by Arbitrum’s Layer 2 scaling solution. This integration represents the convergence of two critical pillars of the DeFi ecosystem.


V1 of this product will be released upon conclusion of the on-going Paladin Audit expected ~3-4th week of October.






Tokenomics and Liquidity: oRDO token incentives will be introduced in October as part of our sustainable,
 on-going incentive program for passive liquidity providers
. This is based on the Bond Protocol options tokens (oToken) model


RDO/ETH LP pool on Camelot Dex will be incentivized with GRAIL/xGRAIL as well as a Rodeo Nitro Pool






Scaling: With additional incentives for lenders on Rodeo, our lending pool will continue to expand, allowing increased capacity for existing farming strategies. Our most popular farms have already been maxed out, and sidelined capital is awaiting future capacity raises to deploy. These self imposed caps are largely the constraint for driving more liquidity to our partner protocols, and will be increased following the Paladin Audit .






Q1 2024:






Yield Bearing Token Leverage Product V2: We acknowledge that the current LST market is largely liquidity on Ethereum mainnet, as such we aim to launch a Chainlink CCIP powered update which will allow users to bring liquidity from cross chain to utilize on Arbitrum, deepening the liquidity available for use in the Arbitrum ecosystem






Vaults: The first Rodeo vault product will be a USDC based vault with a “set and forget” strategy where users can deposit USDC stable assets and Rodeo will automatically allocate to the highest yield earning opportunities on Arbitrum




the vault will also utilize Rodeo leverage in limited scope dictated by specific risk parameters to increase the yields


the goal is to build the USDC vault on Rodeo into the coziest place to park USDC and earn transparent amplified yield (making use of the existing opportunities on Arbitrum)








Misc:

Security: An overarching theme in our short term roadmap is a continuous focus on security improvements. Through regular audits, and a white hat bounty program, we will continue to bolster the security of the platform and build user trust


Farms: We remain committed to providing the best yield earning opportunities for our users, a such we are continuously looking to partner and integrate with the best protocols across Arbitrum

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives:


As a CDP protocol, Savvy focuses on increasing bottom-line metrics like user deposits and loan origination. The primary objectives of the grant are to increase incentives across the Savvy products to enhance adoption and to increase liquidity depth across pools to strengthen project health.






Boost yields to capture users from competing EVM chains.






Increase Liquidity Mining Emissions in ARB to increase stable swap pool health.






Increase trust and legitimacy by being part of the Arbitrum Grant Ecosystem.






Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):


Savvy will measure the direct metrics of the above Objectives to assess performance.






Increase in deposits to the Savvy protocol.






Increase in borrowing from the Savvy protocol.






Increase in TVL of stable swap pools of the Savvy protocol.






Increase in the overall volume across the Savvy protocol.






Number of unique users interacting with the Savvy protocol.






How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


1) Grow Arbitrum User Base


Although Arbitrum has $2.7bn of TVL, most are in perpetual, cross-collateral lending and dexes. These verticals are a huge part of DeFi. However, they also leave out a large subset of users in DeFi.


Savvy protocol focuses on simplicity, safety, and risk aversion to bring in the masses to unlock their capital and lower their opportunity cost. Savvy is paramount to this, and all strategies available on the protocol are heavily researched before implementation.


Having the grant from the Arbitrum Foundation will allow Savvy to boost yields higher compared to competing projects in other EVM chains. Higher yields will create a natural onboarding funnel for all customer segments, driving more retail adoption and increased transaction and wallet activity.


Furthermore, Savvy recently deployed into Bunni and currently represents over 50% of their TVL on Arbitrum. Liquis has stated that they will be willing to expand to Arbitrum when Bunni reaches $2m in TVL. In this regard, Savvy will also foster growth in the available projects in the Arbitrum ecosystem.


2) Increase Capital Efficiency within Arbitrum


What’s unique about Savvy is its collaborative approach with the existing DeFi protocols on Arbitrum; Savvy vaults can be built over almost everything.  Instead of competing with other protocols, Savvy complements them by depositing funds into them, thus enhancing their TVL without detracting from other projects. By providing additional yield on Arbitrum protocols such as GMD and JonesDAO, Savvy unlocks the dormant value in their yield tokens such as gmdUSD and jUSDC.


3) Increase Value Proposition of Savvy Ecosystem


Increasing the TVL across Savvy will allow Savvy to open new vault options, deepening Savvy’s integrations with the rest of the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem. Furthermore, being the only project to offer BTC-denominated loans, Savvy will drive BTC holdings to Arbitrum.


Justification for the size of the grant:


Savvy is a protocol launched with less than 2% pre-sale with no VC funding and acts as a community-owned DAO. Since our liquidity bootstrapping event in mid-August, Savvy DAO has already voted on two proposals.


Our primary challenge is secondary market liquidity, and increasing yields is an essential component of the collaborative ecosystem approach that strengthens the overall Arbitrum DeFi landscape. The grant we seek is not merely a transaction; it is an investment in the future of decentralized finance on Arbitrum.


The distribution in the schedule above, on top of the current protocol rewards, will create an approximately 120% increase in Liquidity Mining Emissions and a 7x increase in Savvy Booster yields over 16 weeks. As Savvy Booster yields are directly related to protocol debt, a case table is provided under the Execution Strategy below. These ratios and amounts are a healthy mix to scale both sides of the system.


Execution Strategy:

100% of the grant will be used for protocol participation in three ways. Incentives will be distributed weekly from 14 October 2023 through 27 January 2024 for 16 weeks.


1) Liquidity Mining Emissions


As a CDP protocol, Savvy relies on its stable swap pools for healthy protocol performance by design. Under the SVY tokenomics, 39% of the total supply is allocated for this over six years. Currently, Savvy keeps pools and runs Market Making Campaigns on two key DEXs: Trader Joe and Uniswap.


Trader Joe LP rewards are calculated using our in-house subgraphs and are claimable on the Savvy app. Uniswap LP rewards are claimable by staking through Timeless Finance’s Bunni liquidity engine. Due to the structure of both systems, rewards in the form of ARB can easily be included in addition to the current SVY rewards.


Funds allocated for Liquidity Mining Emissions will be divided and distributed with the weekly 
‘
Emission Schedule
’
. The list of pools is subject to change with a Savvy DAO proposal. Still, it will always include SVY or a svToken synthetic as one of the pairs.


Treasury-controlled wallets will be excluded from the ARB incentives.


Below are the average weekly allocations for the available pools:

2) Boosted Protocol Yields


Savvy uses a novel mechanism called the Savvy Booster to incentivize healthy protocol use through long-term staking of the SVY token. 7% of the total SVY supply has been allocated for this. Users who deposit into Savvy and have an open credit line earn additional yield based on their veSVY amount accrued by staking their SVY.


Funds allocated for boosting protocol yields will be distributed to eligible users as ARB alongside SVY rewards. More information on the Savvy Booster can be found 
here
.

Grant Timeline:


The distribution is planned to be concluded by 27 January 2024.


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and does the multi sig holds the power to halt your stream?:


Yes.




SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:


Yes.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?:


Arbitrum only.


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?:


06/12/2023


Protocol Performance:


After our soft launch of Savvy in June, our Market Making Campaign produced over $1.6m of pool liquidity across our three synthetic pools within three weeks. This resulted in over $400k of immediate Protocol Owned Liquidity.


Our Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool in early August generated 321 ETH from over 350 participants, and more than 35% of our non-team controlled float is deposited in our staking contract.


Currently, Savvy has $695k TVL in Strategies provided by AAVE, Jones DAO, and GMD.


Savvy’s total volume is approximately $2.2m USD at current-day spot prices for ETH and BTC for the past 30 days. Performing this calculation using TWAP instead, the volume will likely exceed the recommended $2m USD criterion.


Protocol Roadmap:


The Mid-term roadmap of Savvy includes turning on fiat ramps, gauge voting for Savvy pools, and starting protocol redemptions in addition to the constant addition of strategies, collateral types, and use cases.


Audit History:


Halborn has audited Savvy, and no Critical or High-importance issues have been detected. The report can be found

Applicant Name: Stake DAO


Project Name: Stake DAO - “Locking CRV directly on Arbitrum”


Project Description:


Stake DAO is a Decentralized Finance protocol initiated in January 2021 and focused on liquid staking of governance tokens with lock mechanisms (such as CRV or BAL). Liquid Lockers are one of our two major products.


Liquid Lockers enable owners of governance tokens using veTokenomics to enjoy all the benefits of the locking process, without the trade-off of illiquidity, thanks to a derivative: sdToken providing liquidity when you wish to exit your position without waiting for the full duration of the lock.


Even though CRV can only be bridged on Mainnet, its liquid wrapper, sdCRV has been brought to Arbitrum. The idea of this project is to build up the liquidity necessary to successfully bring significant amount of CRV on Arbitrum thanks to the attractivity of CRV liquid staking on Arbitrum, so that CRV farmed on Arbitrum can effectively stay on the chain while deploying their full potential.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size: 200,000 ARB


Grant Breakdown:




200,000 ARB
 distributed until January 31st 2024 as liquidity incentives to asdCRV/CRV liquidity providers on Arbitrum.




Funding Address:
 0xfDB1157ac847D334b8912df1cd24a93Ee22ff3d0


Funding Address Characteristics:
 3/5 Multisig


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives:


Our goal for this grant is to successfully attract liquidity to asdCRV, a tradeable yield bearing wrapped version of locked CRV on Arbitrum, offering an accessible and cost-effective way for CRVholders to benefit from their governance token. More specifically, allowing users to seamlessly lock their governance tokens from the Arbitrum network, making the product accessible to smaller wallets and minimizing gas costs’ impact on user yield. It also allows users to keep their CRV on Arbitrum, while currently farmed CRV need to be bridged back to Mainnet to allow holders to extract their full value.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):


To measure the success of this grant, we will use the following key performance indicators:




Total Value Locked: The total amount of governance tokens in CRV terms that are locked through our Liquid Lockers via Arbitrum.


Locking share: The share of CRV on Arbitrum being locked, compared to circulating.


Liquidity: the total liquidity of asdCRV on Arbitrum.




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


Liquidity rewards will be the main advertising of locking CRV on Arbitrum. Furthermore, the success of liquid staking derivatives depends on the depth of their liquidity, and governance tokens are no exception. Stake DAO’s inflation is not sufficient to incentivise enough liquidity deposits to build solid liquidity for asdCRV, so this grant will be very helpful to incentivise this liquidity, and it should help bring more CRV from Mainnet to Arbitrum. It will give a good solution for users providing liquidity to Curve, Convex, or Stake DAO, to do something with their farmed CRV rewards, which should also make LPing on Arbitrum more attractive.


Justification for the size of the grant:


Currently there are 2m CRV on Arbitrum, but we believe that if there was a possibility to benefit from those CRV on Arbitrum, more of them would stay on the chain. Furthermore, with the Airdrop done by Arbitrum and the current grant program, we believe that incentives will bring more TVL to Arbitrum, and more CRV will be farmed. That being said, we believe it is reasonable to assume around 30m CRV should be brought to Arbitrum within one year. Out of these, assuming a similar locking rate than on Ethereum (around 50%), 15m should get locked. To have a successful liquid staking efficiency with a solid peg, we need to maintain liquidity for around 3m CRV (approximately $750k). To maintain this liquidity, a yield of 35% would be required to be competitive with simply holding asdCRV. The yield could be coming 15% from sdCRV native yield and 20% would come from the ARB tokens granted for this project. An additional incentive would be provided by Stake DAO through direct SDT incentives used as vote incentives on mainnet to direct CRV inflation towards Arbitrum. This 20% APR until January 31, 2024 would correspond to $50k of rewards 
(60k ARB
 tokens), distributed to the asdCRV/CRV Curve pool (asdCRV contract: 0x75289388d50364c3013583d97bd70ced0e183e32, pool to be deployed as soon as the cryptopool factory is live, which should be soon).


In addition to the direct incentives to lock CRV on Arbitrum, we plan on incentivising the following selected Curve pools through ARB vote incentives, to direct more CRV emissions towards Arbitrum and fuel this growth:




USDC/USDT 2pool (0x0f958528718b625c3aebd305dd2917a37570C56a)


Frax Base Pool (0xF82DC74d73bD2E4274fBd087FECB7720F02c3AbC)


EURS/USDC/USDT pool (0x897AB1F979aD31E49DBC9eF8df517b2945A53705)


tBTC/WBTC pool (0xEA13469E4D44246BB84ee8765ba5Bd70d9f87729)


Overnight pool (0x61b7986dD9F1c41747B494680BE1d7EF54265d6c)




We will allocate 
140,000 ARB
 tokens to incentivise these pools proportionately to their TVL until January 31st 2024, which should bring on aggregate $10m to $20m TVL to these pools.


For this purpose, we request a 
200k ARB
 token grant to develop the Curve ecosystem on Arbitrum and bring efficient swap solutions to the chain for a set of key tokens.


Execution Strategy:


Our execution plan includes the following steps:




Technical development:






All the work related to deploying the asdCRV contract on Arbitrum has already been done and is live.


The last mile is to deploy the liquidity pool, for which we are waiting for Curve’s cryptopool factory. If the factory is not done before the second week of October, we shall deploy it as part of this grant program.






Once the pool is deployed, we will deploy the gauge and push the governance vote on Curve’s DAO to make it eligible to CRV incentives.


Incentive campaign: in parallel, a marketing program will aim to bring as much CRV as possible on Artbitrum






Vote incentive campaigns on Votemarket to direct CRV rewards to Curve pools on Arbitrum


Liquidity incentive program for asdCRV liquidity and key Curve pools on Arbitrum (objective of this grant request)




Grant Timeline:


The projected timeline for this grant is fairly simple: as soon as we receive the grant, we will be able to start pushing the incentives to the pools mentioned as stated precisely under this proposal.


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:


No, we initially built our products around Ethereum Mainnet native ecosystems (Curve, Balancer, Frax, Angle…), but have a chain agnostic approach.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?:


We are also deployed on Arbitrum (and marginally on Polygon).


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?:


October 2022


Protocol Performance:


KPIs:




TVL: $57M+


Liquid Lockers TVL: $31M


TVL on Arbitrum: $3m




Past performance:


Since liquid lockers have been launched in 2021, they were the most successful locking solution, before Yearn and Convex. Stake DAO went from 3m CRV locked to 56m CRV locked in a bit more than one year, and has brought $30m of LP in the strategies boosted by those locked CRV.


It has replicated this model on Angle, Balancer, Frax, Pendle, Maverick, and others, and is the first holder of veMAV and of veANGLE, and the third holder biggest liquid wrapper for veFXS, veBAL and vePENDLE.

Besides the lockers, our other product, Votemarket, has been extremely successful as it became by far the biggest vote incentive platform for veCRV vote incentives (source: 
Lobby
). It is a main asset that will help us bring liquidity to Arbitrum.


Protocol Roadmap:


Roadmap for short and medium term includes:




Onlyboost for Curve on Ethereum and Arbitrum (a boost optimiser on top of Curve and Convex, whitepaper: 
https://github.com/StakeDAO/onlyboost-whitepaper/blob/main/ob-whitepaper.pdf
). Live in October.


Other sdTKNlockable on Arbitrum


Onlyboost on Balancer


veBOOST delegation


Balancer strategies and Onlyboost on L2


Claim delegation for Votemarket


Votemarket v2 (with expansion on L2 made possible)




There are several L2 expansion plans in our roadmap. If this grant request is successful, we would like to focus primarily on Arbitrum before any other chain for our L2 development (as we have always done by the way, Arbitrum being the first side chain where we deployed our strategies).


Audit History:


All contracts have been fully audited by Chainsecurity and have been battle tested on the market for more than one year. Stake DAO was never the victim of any hack or exploit. You can find our Audit History here: 
https://lockers.stakedao.org/audits


SECTION 5: Data and Reporting


Is your team prepared to create Dune Dashboards according to program requirements for your incentive program?:


Yes, we will be able to create a Dune Dashboard to measure this grant’s results and relevant metrics by November 15 2023.


The different metrics are:






TVL on Arbitrum Lockers






TVL in the liquidity pool sdCRV/CRV on Arbitrum






Share of CRV locked by chain






Peg maintenance for sdCRV






Unique addresses that use our Lockers via Arbitrum

GMX - Arbitrum DAO Application (revised structure)


Category: Non-Constitutional AIPs


1. Abstract




This grant application encompasses a comprehensive range of initiatives designed to stimulate widespread engagement with and on-chain activity for DeFi on Arbitrum, by increasing the adoption and activity focused on GMX V2.


The proposal prioritizes creating a diverse range of perpetual and spot pools that are highly liquid and capital-efficient. These pools, with liquidity provider tokens, will generate yields that are composable with other protocols.


GMX requests DAO delegates to consider approving incentives around its V2 with a maximum of 12.0 million ARB tokens, plus consideration of an additional 2.0 million ARB tokens for a GMX-administered liquidity and volume program directed at ecosystem partners building on GMX V2 that don’t directly receive incentives from the Arbitrum DAO. Now subject to an overall cap of 12.0 million ARB in accordance with section 1.1 below.


Intentionally Deleted


The key focus areas are: converting CEX users to DEX users, promoting the development and integration of Arbitrum protocols on GMX V2, targeted incentivizing of provision of liquidity, and fostering a vibrant on-chain trading environment.


A special thank you to GMX community members 
0x_dav
, 
SniperMonke01
, Shogun, and 
Saurabh Dhekale
 for assisting in preparing this proposal for consideration by the Arbitrum DAO.




1.1. Amended Ask


Discussing with delegates, there is strong and unequivocal support for GMX’s proposal but also a mutual desire that smaller proposals and newer protocols have an opportunity to participate in the program and not be crowded out by large projects, even if meritorious.


This feedback deeply resonated with contributors and the community at GMX, and how this is an opportunity to pay it forward and hopefully support the next GMX to grow. Therefore, GMX is lowering its STIP proposal to Delegates by 2 million ARB to 12 million ARB. The hope is to create at least five additional Beacon & Siren grants to newer builders & communities.


Delegates will do their best at evaluating proposals, steering the limited resources available, and looking at how these proposals maximize Arbitrum and its ecosystem’s growth.  Many proposals will not gain support today, but opportunities will exist in the future, including STIP Round 2, so they can support Arbitrum’s growth and for Arbitrum to support yours.


This amendment has been placed at the top of the proposal, and the rest of the proposal should be read with this new upper limit being considered.


2. Past, Present, and Future of GMX


2.1. Introduction


GMX is a non-custodial, decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading spot and leveraged perpetual contracts, with a leading position in terms of adoption, TVL, liquidity, and revenue. In daily fee revenue, GMX nowadays trails only some of the most prominent crypto protocols, such as Uniswap and Aave. In the derivatives category, GMX ranks first as the top derivatives project based on the past 365 days’ fees.


GMX deployed on Arbitrum along with its mainnet launch, and its accomplishments can be attributed in no small part to the robust technical infrastructure of Arbitrum. Arbitrum’s underlying architecture has allowed GMX, as well as other DeFi protocols, to provide traders with notable advantages like low latency, minimal transaction fees, and swift transaction processing with no front running.


GMX played a significant role in initiating the discussion and delivery of “real yield” within the DeFi space. As one of the protocols driving this narrative, GMX V1 championed the distribution of protocol revenues back to GMX liquidity providers and token holders, totaling over $190m lifetime and over $100m in the past 365 days to the Arbitrum ecosystem. This showcases the project’s dedication to its token holders and reinforces its commitment to ensuring that the Arbitrum community benefits directly from the platform’s success.

2.2. Fostering organic growth in the Arbitrum ecosystem (key statistics as of Sep 15)


Despite intense competition, where rivals have employed aggressive liquidity mining and trading incentives campaigns, GMX has adeptly held its ground and consistently been the largest protocol on Arbitrum in TVL, fees, protocol revenue, and gas consumption. The DeFi community has maintained its confidence in the platform, driving Arbitrum adoption and consolidating its user base at 50% of the total Arbitrum Perp user base (left graph below). GMX TVL and activity have proven to be sticky, locking between 20 and 40% of all Arbitrum TVL (right graph below) and circa $400m $GMX liquidity consistently over the last year, and GMX has been amongst the top perpetual protocols across DeFi.

Figure: GMX has adeptly held its ground with a constant user base despite the intense competition 




Figure: GMX TVL represented the most deep-liquidity market with 20-40% of Arbitrum TVL  








Contributing to building Arbitrum’s DeFi ecosystem has been a large part of GMX’s growth over these last two years, being both a social responsibility and good business. More players in this space (including competitors) brings more innovation, more users, and more opportunities for users to come and stay on Arbitrum.


GMX has established collaborations across Arbitrum, working with almost every leading protocol to foster a robust collaborative environment. This interconnectedness within the GMX ecosystem extends its benefits to all participating projects. Projects including Pendle, MUX, Abracadabra, Jones DAO, Dopex, Silo, GMD, Plutus, Lyra, Umami, Redacted Cartel, Dolomite, GBC, STFX, and more have been able to build sustainable projects leveraging GMX as a source of yield, liquidity, and trading. A commitment to security, an open development platform, and collaborative market leadership have allowed GMX to directly contribute to the broader adoption and growth of DeFi on Arbitrum.

2.3. GMX V2


GMX V2 was set in motion with discussion on the GMX forums starting in mid 2022 about the next iteration and direction of GMX. Over time the constraints of a product like GLP, designed for a certain set of assets and size, limited its ability to fully leverage its potential at scale.


V2 is a more ambitious concept; looking at many of the successes and limitations that came out of the experiment that was GMX and GLP, and building a new protocol from the ground up.


GLP proved that there was a desire for community liquidity to support and earn from the utility of creating deep perp markets on-chain. This meant that there wasn’t a need to rely on professional market makers who, on CEXs and even in DeFi, would do so mostly on the basis of preferential deals extracting value from the ecosystem. GMX helped pioneer that Oracles could effectively support price discovery of assets and be utilized to provide liquidity providers a more equitable return on risk and capital by not bleeding excess value to MEV.


GMX’s results over the last two years show a fundamental demand from traders to have sovereignty over their assets, control of their positions, transparent pricing, assured protocol solvency (always 100% backed, verifiable on-chain), and isolated risk (as traders only have the funds of a specific position exposed to the GMX protocol, while they continue to have the flexibility to interact with the rest of the vibrant DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum.)


Arbitrum is an environment built to support the best of Ethereum DeFi. One protocol after another integrated with GMX, showing a strong need for yield-generating assets, capital-efficient trading, hedging on-chain, and supporting a wide range of strategies.


This section is called V2, so why so much talk about V1? Everything learned by the community was carried forward, and those foundations were further built upon. V2 is powered by new low-latency Oracles that were designed over the last year working with Chainlink and launched first on Arbitrum powering GMX V2. They provide a whole range of additional data streams and exceptionally low-latency trading, giving GMX real-time price updates and faster on-chain execution. The result is strengthened protocol performance and data security, plus help with mitigating frontrunning risks.


V2 liquidity pools are isolated to each market/asset (now referred to as GM), thus allowing the support of a multitude of markets without adding collective risk. This provides more flexibility for liquidity providers to support the markets they want, and market forces to scale up new markets that traders are interested in by committing liquidity (since liquidity providers can earn with enhanced trading volumes relative to the asset base).


For traders and protocols, in addition to lower trading fees, V2 has a robust set of market parameters that encourage more balanced open interest. These parameters include differential trading fees based on market balance, the ability to configure borrow fees for over-/underweight open interest, and the opportunity to also earn funding fees. This results in more liquid markets, allowing trades of substantial size in any market conditions, and making GMX a preferred venue to trade, hedge and earn.


V2 will help support countless builders on Arbitrum to create the products that users want and don’t even yet know they need.

Medium


2.4. Facilitating the onboarding of additional users and builders with GMX V2


While GMX V1 found Product-Market Fit and created a unique moat built around a community of liquidity providers and builders leveraging these deep liquid markets, the emergence of GMX V2 has the potential to further propel the growth of Arbitrum as a holistic ecosystem. GMX V2 was built with a vision of creating a liquidity layer that can provide other protocols and individual users a better experience, reduce trading fees, and limit LP risks.


GMX V2 beta has been live for circa one month, bootstrapped without incentives or commercial efforts. In this limited time, GMX V2 has outperformed its predecessor with multiple times more capital efficiency and larger returns for liquidity providers.

CEXes have historically been the top traders’ choice, with circa 97% market share (see graph below). GMX V2 is positioned to directly compete in that market. GMX V2’s objective is to facilitate the seamless onboarding of more users from centralized venues onto the Arbitrum chain.

report


To achieve such an ambitious objective, GMX is requesting a grant from the Arbitrum DAO to incentivize GMX V2 growth by assisting in bootstrapping its markets and supporting the integration of other builders on GMX V2. GMX will continue to foster a collaborative environment, allowing multiple protocols to succeed with the integration into its neutral layer. This integration-friendly approach enables seamless interoperability and synergy, empowering protocols to focus on innovation while leveraging GMX’s underlying infrastructure. This collaborative approach will facilitate collective growth and advancement on Arbitrum.


2.5  Responsible treasury asset management


GMX is driven by responsible treasury management and will continue to do so with any granted capital. Retaining the airdrop from Arbitrum DAO to strengthen the GMX safety fund. The safety fund’s core component is the $5 million Immunefi Bug Bounty program, supported by ARB, ETH, and USDC held by the GMX treasury. By retaining these tokens, GMX reaffirms its commitment to ongoing development on Arbitrum and active participation within the DAO. This long-term alignment guarantees GMX’s continued involvement and contribution to the ecosystem’s growth.


GMX is committed to collaborating with the Arbitrum Foundation and deploying the granted capital in initiatives that provide a proportionally greater return to the Arbitrum ecosystem.


3. Grant request specifications


3.1. Objectives


The primary objectives of the requested grant are as follows:




Onboard new users who stimulate sustainable on-chain activity and Total Value Locked (TVL) growth


Encourage the growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem by attracting new builders to leverage the opportunity to build on top of the GMX layer


Promote a strong and sustainable ecosystem that benefits all participants




With this grant, GMX aims to solidify its position as a leading derivatives exchange and provide a seamless trading experience for users. Alongside, GMX will implement several new features, such as enhancements for Traders, faster execution speed, and lower slippage.


3.2. Program design & Allocation principles


The program is designed to distribute incentives at three different levels:




Builder engagement: Incentivize builders to integrate with GMX and encourage them to build on top of GMX through grants, utilizing GMX as a base layer


Trading incentives: Reduced trading fees to incentivize platform usage


Liquidity provision: Incentivize lenders to enhance current liquidity levels




Overall, the program design aims to create a virtuous cycle where increased trading volume, TVL, and the number of builders mutually reinforce each other, fostering a more robust Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem. As the ecosystem grows and becomes more vibrant, it can attract more users, increase adoption, and ultimately contribute to the global advancement of DeFi – with Arbitrum fulfilling Ethereum’s core promise of a high-performance decentralized finance industry.


While there is a need to remain flexible with the detailed incentive distribution, there are certain allocation principles proposed:




Trading incentives will not be higher than fees paid,
 to avoid the possibility of wash-trading. The goal is to increase usage by actual users drawing them to GMX and Arbitrum


Adjust incentive distribution to attract CEX traders by offering a strong user experience, deep liquidity, and comparable fees with the advantage of self-custody and the added benefit of starting to engage more broadly in DeFi


Continuous monitoring and flexibility to adjust the incentive distribution to meet the program goals




3.3. Timeline


This proposal was originally created with a larger grant application and a one-year funding plan with quarterly updates. With the Arbitrum DAO commencing efforts to establish a temporary and eventually formal framework in the coming months, anticipate that this proposal from GMX starts under the Short-Term Incentive Program (
STIP
) and then, when appropriate, be reviewed for a long-term program.


Currently, GMX seeks an initial mandate under the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program, extendable up to an additional 3 months (funded monthly) in the event that a framework has not yet been approved by the Arbitrum DAO for handling such programs.


The Arbitrum Liquidity multisig will at all times have the ability to stop payments if GMX is not distributing funds in a manner that matches the committed goals.


3.4. Incentives distribution


A maximum of:




6.0 million ARB for trading incentives including trading contests


6.0 million ARB towards liquidity incentives


2.0 million ARB to support protocols with integrations




Note 1: Trading incentives (A) and Integration incentives (C) which are not distributed within 60 days of the completion of the initial framework period will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO


Note 2: Liquidity incentives’ (B) effectiveness will be monitored monthly and might be redistributed into (A) or (C) if it is considered more productive in achieving the program objectives


Note 3: GMX is willing to deploy the incentives in alternative mechanisms to those proposed below, in accordance with the Arbitrum DAO and its framework. 
The aim is to remain flexible and be able to generate the largest impact, based on section 3.1. Objectives and 3.2. Program design and Allocation principles.


3.5. Overall grant value


The total maximum grant requested for this proposal is 14.0m ARB tokens with the allocation suggested in the following table.

With the time to start working with protocols on distributions, it’s possible that initial disbursements on integration support will trail until fully ramped up.


3.6. Rationale and use of up to 6.0 million ARB for trading incentives




Source: Trading fees table of GMX and competitors,.Delphi Digital 
report
, Binance Futures fee structures 
website
._ Fees for other leading volume perp dexes reflect their pricing excluding rebates or incentives, which have in some cases resulted in negative trading fees._


The ask is an 
allocation not an assured distribution
, targets have been set based on the comparison of trading fees with Binance and the analysis of similar incentive programs run by other high-volume Perpetual DEXes. The final distribution of incentives into Trading Incentives, Contests, and Competitions will be decided on a monthly basis.


Trading incentives will be established initially on a weekly epoch.  It is proposed that combined trading fees and rebates can bring average fees to a level comparable to Binance VIP0 levels. Not all trades will be equally incentivized, with rebate multipliers for certain trading actions including but not limited to trades that improve O/i, specific markets (ARB), and undertaking certain on-chain activities. The goal is to incentivize utilization and not to pay for trading activity. Trader incentives will be paid out against all qualified trades during the epoch factoring in multipliers and limiting rebates to actual fees paid.


In October the initial epoch will be set at 300,000 ARB per week and will continue to be adjusted both in length and values within the existing maximum budget approval.  The remaining amounts will be allocated mainly between trading contests & targeted CEX campaigns.


3.7. Rationale and use of the 6.0 million ARB towards liquidity incentives


As with GMX V1, which was incentivized via esGMX emissions with capital remaining sticky post-incentives based on the consistency of the protocol, a grant allocation could incentivize GMX V2 LP growth. This grant allocation will accelerate the path to a strong liquidity and yield layer that other protocols can build on (currently GMX V2 has, at times, 
reached the maximum liquidity capacity for traders
)




The primary mode of distribution of liquidity incentives will be directed at V2 markets, with the below chart reflecting the intended initial distribution. A portion of the Flexible distribution may also be utilized to test out incentives for minting / redeeming of GM tokens.


3.8. Rationale and use of the 2.0 million ARB to support protocol and integrations


This allocation will support protocols and integrations that haven’t or were not eligible to participate directly in STIP, but which support the adoption of GMX V2. It is directed to support wallets, crypto gateways and upcoming protocols that meet certain minimum requirements in terms of safety, security, and reputation (GMX will consult and seek advice from the Arbitrum Foundation and/or the Liquidity Multisig as appropriate to ensure this is done with proper compliance).


Such integrations will distribute incentives to users who utilize GMX contracts through these integrations in a manner that in principle, matches the same objectives. These users will receive incentives through grants for providing liquidity, engaging in trading activities, and contributing to the extension of GMX’s features, completing integrations, grants, and Request For Proposals (RFPs). This approach establishes a channel that connects GMX’s growth to the entire ecosystem, ensuring mutual benefits and collaborative development.


While GMX is a strong supporter of this avenue that supports external ecosystem builders, hearing the opinion of the community and Arbitrum DAO delegators on it would be appreciated. GMX is committed to providing limited operational support to ensure the success of protocols building on top of the GMX base layer.


4. Appendix


4.1. Benchmarks and Reporting


To ensure the effectiveness of the incentive programs, GMX and the Arbitrum Foundation will establish clear benchmarks that align with the ecosystem’s goals. These benchmarks will be periodically evaluated to gauge progress and success. Additionally, comprehensive reporting mechanisms will be implemented to provide transparent insights into the program’s impact on the ecosystem.


4.2. Third-Party Monitoring


To maintain impartial oversight, third-party auditors recommended by the Arbitrum Foundation will be appointed. These auditors will be responsible for regularly assessing the progress of the incentive programs and providing unbiased feedback reports on a quarterly basis. Their expertise and independent perspective will ensure a fair evaluation of the program’s effectiveness.


4.3. Key Performance Metrics


GMX has sought feedback from Delegates, fellow builders, the Foundation, and Off-Chain Labs while preparing this proposal. Those are not endorsements but a reflection of the commitment GMX has to work within this ecosystem. The programs under this proposal include a combination of rewards, grants, and incentives tailored to various aspects of the ecosystem’s development: dApps deployment, builder & community engagement, liquidity provision, and on-chain activity.


As part of the key performance metrics, the program will closely monitor and evaluate the Total Value Locked (TVL), the number of users, and the number of project integrations on GMX. These metrics provide essential insights into the growth and success of the ecosystem.




TVL serves as a measure of the assets locked within GMX, indicating the level of trust and activity within the platform.


Monitoring on-chain activity helps gauge the overall health and vibrancy of the GMX ecosystem. Higher levels of on-chain activity indicate increased user engagement, liquidity, and utilization of the platform’s features. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of GMX in facilitating secure and efficient transactions on the blockchain.


The number of users reflects the adoption and engagement of the GMX platform, showcasing its ability to attract and retain a thriving user base.


Additionally, the number of project integrations on GMX signifies the platform’s appeal to builders and developers, highlighting its position as a preferred choice for integrating and launching new projects.


By monitoring and optimizing these metrics, the program aims to drive continuous growth and expansion, ensuring the long-term success and sustainability of the GMX ecosystem.




To ensure the effectiveness of the incentive program, the following breakdown of allocations and thresholds will be implemented:


4.4. Anti-Sybil and Anti-Abuse Parameters:


To ensure the integrity of the incentive program, anti-Sybil and anti-abuse parameters will be implemented. If necessary, GMX may use tools like Gitcoin Passport to prevent the incentives from being affected by bots or bad actors if any programs could be Sybilled. These parameters will aim to generate organic volume and attract genuine users to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Measures will be established in consultation with the Liquidity Multi-sig and the GMX DAO to attempt to prevent fraudulent activities and ensure the program’s success.


By implementing this breakdown of incentives and incorporating anti-Sybil and anti-abuse parameters, we aim to foster a healthy and sustainable ecosystem on the Arbitrum network.


4.5. What constitutes the success of a grant?






Success in grants can be gauged by an upsurge in daily trading activity, user count, and the total value locked (TVL) within the protocol. By meticulously monitoring these metrics, the efficacy of endeavors to stimulate the adoption and utilization of both the GMX and Arbitrum platforms can be evaluated.






A rise in the creation of DApps atop the GMX and Arbitrum platforms, alongside an increase in the number of active users engaged with these applications, serves as a benchmark for measuring the success of initiatives aimed at fostering the adoption and usage of GMX and Arbitrum.






The number of grants co-funded alongside the foundation and ecosystem projects, in conjunction with the volume of ecosystem projects supported through the grant program and liquidity incentives, provides tangible indicators of the commitment to nurturing a thriving ecosystem.






A growth in community engagement and activity, encompassing participation in governance and events, can be quantified through metrics such as the count of active community members, submitted proposals, and involvement in community calls and forums.






Testimonials and success stories from recipients of grants and partners within the ecosystem, highlighting the influence of grants on their projects or the ecosystem at large, offer firsthand insight into the grant’s impact.






Enhanced awareness and recognition of the GMX ecosystem and its projects can be measured by metrics such as the number of articles and mentions across mainstream and crypto-specific media outlets, as well as social media engagement and sentiment.






Augmented collaboration and partnerships with other blockchain projects and organizations, culminating in the development of novel and innovative use cases for the GMX ecosystem, signify progress in expanding the ecosystem’s horizons.






The conception and implementation of fresh features and enhancements into the GMX and Arbitrum protocols, informed by insights derived from grant-supported projects and collaborations, can be assessed through metrics encompassing the count of protocol upgrades and improvements executed, as well as feedback from users and ecosystem partners.






An increase in the value of the GMX token and the overall market capitalization of the GMX ecosystem underscores investor confidence in the ecosystem’s long-term viability and growth prospects, indicating a strong outlook for the ecosystem’s sustainability and expansion.






4.6. Timeline 


Upon the approval of this Proposal and the delivery of the ARB tokens, these tokens will be distributed on a monthly basis to the designated multisig. To ensure transparency and monitor progress, GMX will provide a summary of key metrics, such as TVL, trading volume, and other growth indicators through creation of a Dune dashboard. This summary will serve as a benchmark to evaluate progress and highlight specific pools and integrations earmarked for incentives.


Throughout the program, monthly reports, in addition to a comprehensive quarterly report, will be dispatched by GMX. At the culmination of this period, a comprehensive analysis will be furnished, meticulously assessing the outcomes and accomplishments of the proposal. This analysis will provide invaluable insights into the results and overall effectiveness achieved within the stipulated timeframe.


The proposed incentive program aims to catalyze the growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem by providing targeted incentives and rewards. The collaboration between GMX and the Arbitrum Foundation, along with the implementation of benchmarks, third-party auditing, and governance mechanisms, ensures transparency, accountability, and the creation of long-term value for all ecosystem participants.


4.7. Accountability - Multisig


The funds will be securely held in a 4/7 multi-signature wallet, which includes a representative from the GMX multi-signature group, which have supported in various configurations the GMX security multisig, GMX Arbitrum DAO tokens, and the GMX Avalanche Rush multisig.


These trusted individuals are collectively responsible for ensuring that any unused funds are returned to the Arbitrum DAO, including where key performance indicators (KPIs) are not met or if the DAO decides to recall the funds after the initial three-month period.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


3.1 Objectives


Over the past two years we’ve built a sustainable and competitive fully on-chain game. Our game loops have been proven to work well to retain players and reward those who are actively playing.




Our focus for all our objectives is to create second-order effects that ripple throughout Arbitrum.




Realm seeks to achieve two goals with this grant:


3.1.1 Increase activity through Gamified ANIMA LP


All our liquidity is currently on MagicSwap in MAGIC/ANIMA pool. 
All liquidity is community owned.
 You can read more about our approach here: 
ANIMA. Unlocked and Ready | by Realm | Medium


ANIMA is only made available through gameplay. We have a Leaderboard where players compete for top positions in order to get in-game boosts that allows them to attain more ANIMA.We will be using a similar Leaderboard for the ARB Incentives. The higher your position, the more Incentives you’ll get.


This creates a competition between players where they must strategize what position best suits their risk tolerance and incentive potential. Being a Liquidity Provider 
does not
 guarantee you incentives, you must compete.


So what value does this create?




Increase in ANIMA demand


Increase in demand for Liquidity Providers


Increase in liquidity


Increase in activity on-chain through Realm activities


Increase in activity for MagicSwap


Increase in activity in other protocols(i.e. marketplaces, dex/cex and connected games) with new liquidity


Increase in attractiveness of ANIMA, which incentivizes Realm game loops which in turn creates more activity, which benefits Arbitrum






All these increases benefit Arbitrum as it represents activity on-chain.




As you can start to see, it creates a flywheel that fuels itself and fuels all the networks it’s connected to. The grant supercharges all these activity(game) loops and will continue to provide value even after the grant incentives are gone.


3.1.2 Scale Up Loyal User Base


1133×359 12.1 KB


Screenshot 2023-10-02 at 9.16.58 PM
1921×1247 77.9 KB


Our user retention is high, at 81%. We expect to convert new users into loyal users and multiply the on-chain activity that we currently have.


3.2 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):




Increase in DAU


Increase in retention


Increase in daily transactions


Increase in MAGIC/ANIMA liquidity pool


Increase in MAGIC/ANIMA swaps


Increased in MagicSwap MAGIC/ANIMA Volume


Increase in Vested ANIMA LP tokens




3.3 How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


3.3.1 Fostering Growth


The data shows that our game loops are sticky and rewarding to those that are engaged. The grant will allow us add fuel to fire by providing enticing rewards for newcomers and existing users.


This grant will provide incentives to multiply our DAU, Retention and Economy. This in turn creates more network activity for Arbitrum. The grant will bring more on-chain activity through our numerous activities:




Providing Liquidity through MagicSwap


Vesting of LP Tokens


Competitive in-game rewards


Daily Battles


Daily Missions


Weekly Leaderboard contests


Weekly Production of Collectibles


Daily Structure Building


Cycle of Crafting Peripherals and usage


Maintenance of Realms and Adventurers


LootBox distribution.

3.3.2 Innovation


image
1636×1366 89.3 KB


We are continually innovating with what an on-chain game can look like:






Productive Assets
: Realms and Adventurers are productive assets that allow you to build up more in-game value(on-chain) the more you play. This creates a flywheel of value for those that are actively engaged.






Fully on-chain LootBox Platform
: We created a LootBox Platform that allows us to dispense any ERC1155, ERC721 or ERC20 to our users. We have already incorporated Treasure and Knights of the Ether items and will be looking to continue our push for interoperability.






Ever Evolving Assets
: Since day one, our approach was to create ownership of an asset that changes based on your activity. Realmers have been doing this for 2 years+. Their Realms and Adventurers have been growing in uniqueness and in-game value. All this data is stored on-chain.






Interconnected Game loops
: We’ve created a dualistic economy that fuels itself forward. We’ve done this by creating game loops that are fueled by activity and rewarding those who take the time to build up their assets.






AI + Blockchain
:  We’re pioneering a novel approach where AI dynamically crafts game assets and their traits based on user activity. We are beginning with crafting but it will permeate all aspects of the Realm ecosystem. Our rich game meta-data is one of out most valuable assets, and it’s all stored directly on-chain in the Arbitrum network.

3.4 Justification for the size of the grant:






We have sticky user base + strong retention without additional incentives, demonstrating that adding incentives is more likely to retain a large proportion of users. This would lead to multiplying all our metrics(DAU, Transactions per month, second-order effects)






Realm is a core TIP09 partner of Treasure, and worked closely with the Treasure core team on game integrations (participating as a game/guild that players play to compete in the Bridgeworld Harvester metagame that underpins the Treasure gaming ecosystem).






Realm is one of few fully on-chain games which launched when Arbitrum launched in 2021. Realm will help Arbitrum establish a reputation for unique emerging web3 game categories such as Autonomous Worlds.






3.5 Execution Strategy:


3.5.1 Proven Game Loops


This is not theoritical. Our game loops are working today and have proven to create loyal and active players. These incentives would act as a catalyst to bring scale to our user base.  In turn, this will create network effects for Realm, Treasure and Arbitrum.


1600×860 102 KB


Because of our interconnected, interoperable protocol, every action creates an incentive for players to continue to interact with Realm and the greater ecosystem(Treasure and Arbitrum). The above diagram is merely one facet of our protocol showing how it promotes continual activity within Realm. Every arrow is an on-chain transaction(or set of transactions) that players make.


This has been the underpinning and ethos of Realm since day one. To create a network of experiences that causes all boats to rise with the tide.


3.5.2 Preventing Mercenary Farming


We are aware that players will attempt to farm these rewards. We have several mechanisms in place that will prevent mercenaries from taking rewards and leaving the ecosystem.


3.6 Grant Timeline:


Bi-weekly distribution of funds that will go towards our objectives:




Increase activity through Gamified ANIMA LP


Scale Up Loyal User Base

Grant Matching:


No matching funds available


Grant Breakdown:


Gamma proposes a three-month liquidity incentive program. The program would run from November 1, 2023 - January 31, 2024.


The program would distribute 250,000 ARB monthly for three months to liquidity providers who participate in qualified Gamma vaults built on top of liquidity pools of our six currently supported AMMs.


Since we have already deployed on Arbitrum and our partner AMMs, we would not require any development funds for this grant. 100% will be going to LPs.


Funding Address:


0x8beFf353FCb2E288fdFFbb0b2B61B4c76dc700Df 
- Gamma Community Treasury Arbitrum


Funding Address Characteristics:


2/3 GnosisSafe multisig with stored keys. 
Link
.


Contract Address:


Gamma will deploy specific rewarder contracts (
example
) for each AMM to properly disperse funds. Rewarder contracts will be posted 
here
 in our Contracts Repository.


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives:


Our objective is to deploy liquidity incentives on three native AMMs (Ramses, Camelot, and Zyberswap) and two non-native AMMs (Uniswap, SushiSwap, and Pancakeswap), to increase liquidity on the Arbitrum network.


Compared to other grant proposals, our priority is to find unbiased, undercapitalized pools on the Arbitrum network.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):




Total Value Locked (TVL)
 - Evaluating the amount of liquidity that has entered the liquidity pools via Gamma’s vaults


Volume Through Vaults (VTV)
 - Evaluating the amount of volume that Gamma vaults have facilitated


𐤃 Volume
  - Evaluate the change in volume in the pool prior to incentivizing Gamma vaults


Slippage
 - Measuring slippage on a variety of hypothetical trades.


Efficiency
 - Evaluate the actions of DEX aggregators toward incentivized pools


TVL / Volume
 - Evaluating the capital efficiency of each pool by understanding the volume to TVL ratio.


LP Performance
 - Evaluating the performance of LPs from fixed points in time. These include Gamma vault vs hold, hold 100% token0, and hold 100% token1.




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


Liquidity incentives are critical to bootstrapping and building healthy decentralized liquidity pools on a growing blockchain. Correctly allocated and managed concentrated liquidity pools allow low slippage trading, which is vital to a healthy network.


Gamma receiving this grant creates long-term ideal liquidity conditions for liquidity providers, traders, and our partner AMMs. Gamma also has the incentive to find undercapitalized pools that “fill the gaps” between proposals from exchanges or other liquidity mangers.


Justification for the size of the grant:


Gamma passes all the metrics for a Siren grant.


Gamma has invested significant resources to integrate natively with many of the major DEXs on Arbitrum, including Uniswap, Zyberswap, Ramses, Camelot, Pandcakeswap, and SushiSwap.


Many of these integrations were bespoke integrations that involved integration with not only their smart contracts (UniswapV3Pool.sol, AlgebraPool.sol v1.0, AlgebraPool.sol v1.9, AlgebraPool.sol v2.0, and RamsesV2Pool.sol) but with each DEX’s unique rewarder infrastructure including the Angle Merkl rewarder for Uniswap and Sushi, MultiFeeDistribution contract for Ramses, and Camelot’s spNFT liquidity locking contract.


We’ve spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on blue-chip audits with ConsenSys Diligence for our main position manager smart contracts, and we have a prepaid two-week/two-person audit with OpenZeppelin specifically for our hedging vaults that will integrate natively with GMX v2 on Arbitrum to hedge against impermanent loss on our positions.


Additionally, we are running four servers to handle the data infrastructure and two dedicated servers to handle the automation of these positions. We’re also subscribed to the highest-tier RPC plans to handle the load on Arbitrum where we average well over 1.8 million RPC requests daily. We are also subscribed to the enterprise plan for OpenZeppelin Defender, which provides the execution layer for both our LP positions and our hedging strategies.


We were also active proponents of supporting Arbitrum liquidity in Uniswap’s governance forum. We authored a 
Uniswap governance proposal
 to utilize Uniswap’s $ARB DAO airdrop to support liquidity on Arbitrum. This proposal garnered 
significant support
 amongst Uniswap delegates, with 50.03M in support of the proposal with only 5.52M opposed.


Gamma is currently integrating a sixth AMM, Pancakeswap, and they will be included in the program.


Execution Strategy:


If funds are awarded to Gamma, we will immediately begin talks with our partner AMMs on identifying appropriate pools to incentivize.


Not listing the pools here is 
not an attempt to be purposely ambiguous
, but more to have 
flexibility
 about how we’re going to be distributing incentives. In our experience, these kinds of choices are made with the most possible information, closer to game time.


Gamma will take into account pairs that are already being incentivized and search for under-capitalized pools based on our analysis of trading activity on the Arbitrum network.


Our methodology on choosing pairs comes down to the following factors:.




Native pairs to Arbitrum (these pairs tend to need the most liquidity and are undercapitalized)


Critical infrastructure pairs (WETH, ARB, WBTC, stablecoins, and most users regularly use)


Pairs that play to the strengths of the AMM they’re on.


Avoiding already incentivized pairs by another organization


Avoiding overcapitalized pairs


Structuring incentives so AMMs are not working against each other inefficiently

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size:
 750,000 ARB


Grant Matching:
 N/A


Grant Breakdown:




GLP Vault Incentives: 750,000 ARB


Vesting Distribution: ~187,500 ARB/Month


Vesting Period: Incentives will be distributed evenly from the day they are granted to the end of the short-term incentives program, 31st January 2024.




The incentivisation mechanism we plan to use takes inspiration from Dolomite’s oARB mechanism in their Forum Proposal, with minor changes being made to better fit our protocol. We find this method of incentivisation best protects Arbitrum from instant dumping of rewards, and instead favors longer term incentive alignment for liquidity farmers, creating a better outcome for both Umami and Arbitrum.




Users can stake their Umami vault receipt tokens for oARB emissions.


oARB is continuously emitted and can be vested on a first-come, first-serve basis.


We will use a simple MasterChef or Gauge contract for the emissions


oARB that’s emitted can be staked for x duration (in increments of 1 week up to 4 months) and must be paired with the same amount of ARB (1:1 ratio).



For example, vesting 100 oARB requires you pair it with 100 ARB in the contract


We’ll represent each stake a user takes as unique NFT locks so popular DeFi dashboards can track them






After the vesting period, the underlying ARB can be obtained for a y% discount to the oracle price


The discount will depend on how long the oARB is locked for and will be linear from 1 week to 16 weeks with each additional week adding 2.5% to the discount. This is subject to change pending feedback.



1-week is a 2.5% discount


2-weeks is 5% discount


…


15-weeks is 37.5% discount


16-weeks is 40% discount


As demonstrated with this discount schedule, staking to achieve the max discount requires users hold the paired ARB for longer, a positive result for the Arbitrum ecosystem as users have their interests aligned for longer.






The price will be determined via Chainlink oracle at the time of purchase



This guarantees fair pricing and that farmers will make money when they execute the options.


Keep in mind, oARB must be paired with ARB on a 1:1 basis to begin vesting. This should help offset ARB sell pressure and constrain users from vesting oARB too quickly if they accumulate a large amount (similar to esGMX and GMX vesting). It also helps align incentives of farmers with Arbtirum






If the ARB rewards pool is depleted, all remaining oARB tokens expire worthless


Staked ARB (that’s paired with oARB) will be deposited in Dolomite to improve capital efficiency for farmers


We want to avoid giving the tokens away for free since it encourages dumping at the expense of ARB in exchange for boosting Umami’s TVL. That would be a bad outcome for Arbitrum, and we would rather be positive sum for the ecosystem!


Users will receive their exercised oARB as ARB tokens in their wallet


How lucrative is this for farmers?



Suppose we emit $333k worth of ARB over 2 months ($2M annualized). The max discount is 40%, which means $800k worth of annualized value is emitted


If Umami gets $10M in TVL to stake (more than doubling our current TVL), the max reward APR would be 8% - why?



$2M annualized * 40% discount = $800k in value delivered to farmers.


$800k / $10M = 8%






Note: this program will be even more lucrative when staked deposits are lower, encouraging more yield farmers to participate

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives:




Increase Arbitrum and Umami user base by leveraging partnerships with other Arbitrum projects to cross-promote.


Improve Umami Vaults’ TVL efficiency by incentivizing equal TVL distribution between vaults.


Increase liquidity for GMX traders by incentivizing further deposits into Umami’s GLP vaults


Boost vault performance and yields, including real yields through more internal netting thanks to more deposits.


Educate users on Umami product offerings by leveraging social media for maximum reach.




KPIs:




TVL growth - 10M TVL by end of January (250% increase)


User growth and retention (Analytics page)


Vault APR performance (Measure internal netting efficiencies due to incentives)




Innovation and Growth:

The grant will amplify our vaults’ yields and draw attention to both Umami and Arbitrum as the home of the highest single asset exposure yields in DeFi… Umami is a highly symbiotic protocol; as well as offering the clearest view on the actual performance of GMX’s GLP, increasing vault TVL is mutually beneficial to GMX and the Arbitrum ecosystem: as users come to appreciate the benefits of our vaults all parties will see a healthy increase in the coveted ""sticky TVL”.


Looking ahead, the credibility that Umami has garnered from the overwhelming technical success of the GLP vaults puts the protocol in excellent standing for the upcoming launch of its GMX v2 vaults. We believe these vaults will offer an incredibly compelling value proposition for prospective GMX v2 LPs seeking a simpler and easier to track alternative to the perhaps overwhelming choice of depositing into GMX v2 directly.


Justification for Grant Size:

Umami has shown consistent innovation since its October 2021 inception and has evolved from Olympus DAO-like tokenomics to generating real revenue through our products. As an OG project with over $4m TVL, Umami is leading Arbitrum in real yield ETH, USDC and wBTC products. The proposed grant size is in line with the grant guidelines for a project of our TVL and OG status. The grant will help bring more liquidity to GMX and bring more “real yield” to arbitrum. Umami offers the best risk-adjusted returns in real yield for any of the provided assets on any chain and the grant would help highlight this and attract new users to Arbitrum as a result.


Execution Strategy


Resources and Products: Our team comprises experts in Solidity, Frontend and Webstack Development, Market and Liquidity Strategy, Treasury Management, and Social Media Marketing. We are prepared to allocate these resources effectively to fulfill the objectives set out in this grant proposal.


Use of Funds: The 750,000 ARB will be wholly allocated to incentivize our GLP vaults on Arbitrum. This is aimed at bringing more users to both the Arbitrum ecosystem and our innovative Umami vaults.


Incentive Allocation: Our aim is to strategically weigh incentives to maximize total value locked (TVL), thereby optimizing internal netting performance. To start we will target:






40% to glpUSDCb






30% to glpETHb






28% to glpBTCb






1% to glpLINKb






1% to glpUNIb






This allocation is informed by current demands and liquidity trends on the Arbitrum network, as well as our overarching strategy of balanced risk and diversified yield.


Adaptive Weight Adjustments: As we analyze the responsiveness of the market to these incentives, we will be ready to adjust the weights to optimize deposits where they are most needed, thereby refining our APY and attracting a broader set of users.


Risk Management: To mitigate risks associated with smart contracts and fund management, we will rely on contracts with already comprehensive third-party audits. These tested and proven contracts for token emissions and reward distribution will allow us to regularly update our community on progress and any changes through transparent reporting.


Performance Metrics: KPIs will be monitored closely to ensure that our strategy is yielding the desired results. This will include TVL, incentives per vault/% of total distributed, user growth, individual vault performance.


Operational Milestones: We will adhere to the grant timeline, which involves multiple phases such as auditing, internal testing, and public releases of new products or versions.


By executing this strategy, we aim to foster increased adoption, innovation, and liquidity in both Umami’s products and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size
: Between 200,000 $ARB and 700,000 $ARB, to be released according to milestones (see grant timeline below with milestones included).


Grant Matching
: Yes. Native yield in agEUR will distributed from Angle Protocol’s profits and reserves, currently 4% APY on stEUR.


Grant Breakdown
:


As a reminder, stEUR is a staked agEUR paying a fixed 4% APY coming from RWAs held in Angle’s reserves and protocol fees.


The grant will be distributed to (see grant timeline below for milestones):




incentivize a stEUR/USDC Camelot v3 pool from 1 November 2023 to 31 January 2024 with up to 250,000 $ARB;


incentivize a stEUR/ARB Camelot v3 pool from 1 November 2023 to 31 January 2024 with up to 250,000 $ARB;


incentivize a stEUR/wstETH Camelot v3 pool from 1 November 2023 to 31 January 2024 with up to 100,000 $ARB;


incentivize the use of stEUR as collateral to borrow USDC on a native lending protocol (Radiant) with 100,000 $ARB (to be unlocked only if the integration is secured prior to December 15, 2023);




If this grant request is approved, Angle will immediately:


(1) deploy stEUR and native agEUR staking on Arbitrum in order to create the first RWAs and Euro based savings rate on Arbitrum;


(2) add $ARB as a token to mint agEUR natively on Arbitrum;


(3) work on use cases and integration for stEUR in order to push this program beyond liquidity incentivization (e.g. lending, yield tokenization etc.).


The grant will not be used for development costs, only for supporting the development of stEUR on Arbitrum, promoting RWAs in the ecosytem, enabling integrations across the ecosystem and its pairing with $ARB and $wstETH.


Funding Address
: 
0xAA2DaCCAb539649D1839772C625108674154df0B


Funding Address Characteristics
: 4/6 Safe multisig composed on Angle core team members and ecosystem participants. More details on the multisig composition 
here
.


Contract Address
: Incentivization will go through Merkl, the incentivization tool built by Angle Labs, that enabled concentrated liquidity incentivization. Merkl related contract addresses can be found 
here
.


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives
: The objectives are:




Launch the first RWA and Euro-based yield source on any L2 with 
stEUR
 and bring the first savings rate to Arbitrum


Create deep Euro liquidity on Arbitrum with stEUR and so indirectly with agEUR


Use the development of stEUR on Arbitrum to support $ARB volume and liquidity with a stEUR/ARB pool


Further support the use of $ARB by enabling agEUR minting with $ARB


Use the development of stEUR on Arbitrum to support $ETH volume and liquidity with a stEUR/wstETH pool


Further the use of RWAs-related assets on Arbitrum and taking this program beyond liquidity incentivization by supporting the use of stEUR as collateral on a lending protocol and promoting other use cases




Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
:




Angle TVL on Arbitrum


Number of circulating stEUR on Arbitrum


Percentage of stEUR natively staked on Arbitrum and portion of Angle revenue distributed on Arbitrum (breakdown between Ethereum and Arbitrum)


$ARB volume and liquidity relating to the stEUR/ARB pool to be set up


$wstETH volume and liquidity relating to the stEUR/wstETH pool to be set up




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
:


This is an opportunity to provide all Defi users on Arbitrum (and not only Euro inclined ones) with:




a simple and real yield coming from RWAs;


a state of the art application of RWAs in the space;


composability opportunities with enabling borrowing with stEUR and other use cases.




This grant would make Arbitrum the home of the first Euro and RWA based yield source and the most cost effective option to benefit from that opportunity. Arbitrum would be the first L2 to provide and support such an opportunity with stEUR (staked agEUR).


As mentioned, this will incidentally grow Euro liquidity on Arbitrum giving it a and boost in terms of stablecoins’ and currency’s diversity in the Defi ecosystem.


Justification for the size of the grant
:


agEUR and the Angle Borrowing module have been deployed on Arbitrum since July 2022 to allow native minting of agEUR on the chain.


All these products have undergone audits and development work. This includes significant developement work made by Angle to allow a 1-click leverage from on Curve pools on Arbitrum in the Angle borrowing module.


Angle has been active in the Arbitrum ecosystem, in particular through its Merkl product, the smart incentivization tool that is today used by Uniswap to distribute close to 2M ARB to increase volume and liquidity in several pools but also by DEXes such as Sushiswap and Camelot. Working with these partners have required bespoke integrations and smart contract work to cater to the development of liquidity and volume on Arbitrum for these DEXes.


stEUR is a new product that enables value-sharing by streaming protocol revenue to agEUR stakers.


This grant will:




support the further adoption on Arbitrum of all the above mentioned products (agEUR, agEUR borrowing using $ARB, stEUR and Merkl);


the sizing and duration will allow a compelling support RWAs-related opportunities on Arbitrum;


the sizing and duration will allow the development of a stEUR liquidity to develop use cases for it apart from LPeing in pools (use stEUR as collateral, integration in yield-related products like Pendle etc.);


support both $ARB and $ETH liquidity and volume.




The grant is requested to migrate stEUR stakers to Arbitrum and incidentally support $ARB and $ETH in order to unlock a total TVL in the above-mentioned pools of $14+ millions in total, including, approximately €7m worth of stEUR on Arbitrum (see the grant timeline with milestones below).


Execution Strategy
:


Use of Merkl to incentivize on Camelot v3


The pools to be set up are concentrated liquidity pools on Camelot.


Incentivizing concentrated liquidity is initially difficult to implement. To do so, Angle will use 
Merkl
, the tool developed by Angle Labs.


This tool is already in use since 2022 and trusted by several concentrated liquidity DEXes and projects to incentivize concentrated liquidity including Uniswap, Camelot, Sushiswap, Retro and others.


Fees do not apply when Merkl is used to incentivize agEUR and stEUR pools. This means the the use of Merkl will not incur any fees charged to the benefit of Angle Labs.


Incentivization of the pools for a maximum total of 600,000 $ARB (see grant timeline for milestones)


If found are allocated to Angle to develop the stEUR while boosting the use of ARB and ETH on Arbitrum, we will immeditaly set up the three following pools:




Camelot v3 stEUR/ARB


Camelot v3 stEUR/wstETH


Camelot v3 stEUR/USDC




Incentivization for the use of stEUR as collateral on Radiant  for a total of 100,000 $ARB (see grant timeline for milestones)


Upon incentivization of the above-mentioned pools and development deep liquidity for stEUR on Arbitrum, the Angle team shall seek the listing of stEUR as collateral on Radiant as a native Arbitrum lending protocol and incentivize this use case.


This integration shall be worked on by the Angle team and the selected lending protocol prior to December 15, 2023 to unlock this portion of the grant.


Grant Timeline
:




The grant shall be awarded in three monthly tranches according to milestone as mentioned in the tables below.


If after the first month less than 75% of the global stEUR targets is reached, the program shall be stopped. Above 75%, the program shall continue over the second month.


If after the second month, less that 75% of the second month stEUR global target is reached, the program shall be stopped. Above 75%, the program shall continue over the third month.

SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?
: Yes. Angle protocol was initilly deployed on Ethereum but deployed it borrowing module natively on Arbitrum. This allows the native minting of agEUR on the chain.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?
: agEUR is deployed on at least 12 chains. However the protocol in itself is deployed only on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon.


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?
: agEUR and Angle Borrowing module were deployed on Arbitrum in July 2022.


Protocol Performance
:


As at 27 September 2023, Angle Protocol has a global TVL of $27m and agEUR has 581.k holders.


Angle has newly launched the stEUR on 25 September 2023 at 5pm CET. Currently, 48 hours hours after launch, $3m worth of agEUR have been staked for stEUR.

The protocol is also focused on providing transparency and making protocols’ reserves and financials accessible and readable by all.


Angle has built and maintains an analytics
 showing the protocol balance-sheet, reserves and TVL progression in real time. The goal is to add more details useful to all participants including a soon to come event page that will detail all events by chain. This will also allow tracking of performance on Arbitrum.


Protocol Roadmap
:


Angle newly deployed stEUR on 25 September 2023 (i.e. just 1 day prior to the posting of this proposal). The protocol future roadmap consists in:




re-enforcing the diversification and resilience of the protocol’s reserves by exploring additional collaterals, including yield-producing collaterals;


implementing a fully on-chain governance, it being noted that the on-chain governance will allow voting on both Ethereum and Arbitrum;


Furthering the integrations for the newly launched stEUR;


Delivering more details in the 
analytics
 of the protocol that provide all details to stakeholders on the financial state of the protocol.




Audit History
:


The protocol has been audited:




1 time by Code4rena


3 times by ChainSecurity


1 time by Sigma Prime




No critical findings remained unresolved. Audits are available 
here
.


SECTION 5: Data and Reporting


Is your team prepared to create Dune Dashboards for your incentive program?
: Yes or another dashboard providing a similar level of information.


Does your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread?

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size:


500,000 ARB


Grant Matching:


N/A


Grant Breakdown:


The requested grant will be used to directly incentivize and reward user activity within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The activity will include driving on-chain contributions through Arbitrum protocols that reward users with ARB directly through Galxe’s Token Reward module.


ARB will go directly to the participating users to reward them for their efforts and contributions in each protocol.


Development for our Token Reward module on Arbitrum is already complete, so Galxe can begin our ARB incentives program immediately following the passing of the proposal.


Funding Address:


0xeF80A06933Ad67F16a234e10693B2f935e4a9130


Funding Address Characteristics:


2/5 multisig with private keys securely stored.


Contract Address:


0xeF80A06933Ad67F16a234e10693B2f935e4a9130


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives
:


Galxe looks to achieve many objectives with this grant. Our primary focus is to continue supporting Arbitrum’s ecosystem as a resource for Arbitrum dapps to reach new global audiences in addition to being a tool to reward and manage current community members.


This grant will enable Arbitrum dapps to do the following:




Drive new user growth


Reward their current community


Gamify their engagement through a variety of different ways


Build out their own on-chain loyalty program on Arbitrum


Create their own web3 Arbitrum CRM




On the other hand, Arbitrum users will have the ability to do the following:




Further build out their identity/reputation on Arbitrum via on-chain contributions


Curate anon-chain resume


Discover each of the excellent protocols that Arbitrum has to offer


Educate themselves on the Arbitrum ecosystem




Additionally, we expect the incentives to assist Galxe in furthering our mission of Arbitrum ecosystem growth. Arbitrum protocols have the incredible opportunity to engage with Galxe’s millions of users through ARB incentives.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)




Considering each campaign can request users to perform multiple on-chain actions, our most conservative estimate is that we will drive ~1.5M transactions throughout this incentive program


We expect this to help our Arbitrum ecosystem partners to execute additional Galxe campaign modules on top of the Token Rewards campaign, such as Arbitrum OAT and NFT mints




Galxe has also observed the need for a stronger NFT presence and greater utility for NFTs within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Based on the below screenshots, we believe Galxe OAT is an excellent solution and has the best opportunity to impact the Arbitrum ecosystem in a positive way. Galxe OAT is proven to be the best solution for dapp developers to leverage in community building.


Galxe looks to fulfill the following objectives and help Arbitrum become a leader in the NFT space.




Increase NFT asset transaction volume on Aribtrum


Assist developers in deploying NFT contracts on Arbitrum via Galxe’s no-code dashboard


Grow unique NFT holders on Arbitrum


Amplify secondary marketplace trading on Arbitrum








Source: 
https://arbitrum.nftscan.com/
, 
https://optimism.nftscan.com/


Furthermore, should Galxe receive this grant, we will commit ourselves to integrating an Arbitrum OAT.


BNB OAT
 (deployed in 2021)




8.6M+ minted


1M+ unique holders




Polygon OAT
 (deployed in 2021)




21.3M+ minted


2.2M+ unique holders


Top erc-721 contract on Polygon




Avalanche OAT
 (deployed end of March 2023)




3.1M+ minted


657K+ unique holders




Optimism OAT
 (deployed end of May 2023)




1.8M+ minted


479K+ unique holders




Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for an Arbitrum OAT:




20 Arbitrum native dapps deploy an Arbitrum OAT within 3 months.


20 non-native Arbitrum dapps deploy an Arbitrum OAT within 6 months.


250K total Arbitrum OAT mints within 3 months.


400K Arbitrum OAT mints within 6 months.




To be clear, the ARB incentives will only be used for Arbitrum protocols running Token Reward campaigns on Galxe that incentivize on-chain activity on Arbitrum. An Arbitrum Galxe OAT is not part of the requested grant, but we will commit to integrating it as an additional growth supplement to our Token Reward module and for Arbitrum protocols to seamlessly reward their community members with a gasless badge.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


At Galxe, you’ll attract and engage users from other ecosystems Galxe has worked with that Arbitrum may not have had the chance to interact with yet.


This grant enables Galxe to leverage our community of 12M unique users to explore and engage with Arbitrum’s top protocols through ARB incentives.


Through Galxe credentials, Galxe makes sure only valuable, loyal contributors are getting rewarded. We look forward to maximizing our existing resources at hand to ensure maximum success and growth for Arbitrum is achieved.


At Galxe, with our experience and resources, we’ve accumulated the following accomplishments.




An ecosystem of over 3700+ web3 projects


40K+ campaigns & quests powered


Galxe has over 60M+ NFTs minted directly through our platform, generating ~ $15M worth of gas fees on all supported chains


Twitter of over 1M+ (Verified)


Discord with 555K+ members




All Arbitrum dapps will continue to get strong Galxe support and guidance on running growth campaigns.


We believe that our proposal is directly in line with the goals of the framework in the “Motivation” section on Arbitrum’s STI Program to “Support Network Growth” and to “generate maximum activity on the Arbitrum network.""


Galxe will be supporting Arbitrum network growth in a variety of ways.




Onboarding a global network of existing and new users to Arbitrum via Galxe campaigns and quests


A resource for Arbitrum dapps to grow their protocol and manage their communities through ARB incentives


Most importantly the requested grant will assist Galxe in powering transaction fees in three different ways across the following activities.


Drive transaction fees across the network through user interaction with each protocol. At times, users may be asked to complete multiple on-chain activities within one campaign to become eligible for ARB rewards.


Generate transaction fees when users claim their ARB rewards following verified eligibility


NFT minting fees on Arbitrum generated via Galxe quests for users to mint their reputation badges




Galxe plans to make this program inclusive so any quality Arbitrum protocol in need of ecosystem development can become eligible to incentivize users with ARB. ARB incentives for each protocol will depend on their Space Tier and campaign structure.


At this time, we’re planning on working with the following protocols to kick this program off.




GMX


Trader Joe


XAI


SushiSwap


Vela Exchange


Radiant Protocol


Camelot


Connext


Magpie


WooFi


Stargate


Hop


Frax Finance


Savvy DeFi


Chronos


Clipper


ApeSwap


Notional


Lido


Thales


PancakeSwap




Aside from Galxe’s Token Reward module, Arbitrum protocols can leverage Galxe’s additional gamification modules for other initiatives. The screenshot below is meant to represent the simplicity and easiness of deploying an Arbitrum Token Rewards quest.


1370×886 86 KB


Justification for the size of the grant:


Galxe is looking for a grant of 500,000 ARB that will go directly towards incentivizing and rewarding participating users in Arbitrum campaigns only. The grant is justified by the activity we expect to see in the quests based on our prior experience working directly with the Arbitrum ecosystem and our 12M unique user base looking to explore the Arbitrum ecosystem. Over the past 90 days, the average number of monthly user actions taken on Galxe is 16.3M, and this tells Galxe that users are eager to explore and power activity on-chain. through Galxe campaigns. No part of the grant will be kept by the Galxe team.


Any unused funds will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO on January 31, 2024.


Execution Strategy:


Once the grant is received, the Galxe team will begin to work with our network of Arbitrum partners on execution. The strategy will be focused on working closely with those Arbitrum partners to engage global audiences, incentivize protocol engagement, identify valuable contributors, and reward contributors with ARB through Galxe’s Token Reward module.


Galxe will begin marketing the initiative following the passing of the proposal.


To prevent any abuse of the incentivizes from protocols, Galxe recently introduced our new Space Tiers, representing a dapps ranking within Galxe.


For context, Space Tiers on Galxe gives a partner more availability/access to additional promo support/features among other things that a Lower Tier Space would not have access to. Higher Space Tiers can be achieved by a project’s commitment to running quality campaigns on Galxe consistently. Space Tiers ensures only the highest quality dapps are eligible for the incentives. Galxe plans to leverage our Space Tiers program in determining which Arbitrum Galxe partners are eligible to use the ARB incentives in their Token Reward module campaign. Space Tiers 3 and 4 will be eligible to begin with.


The objective of the Space Tiers system is to incentivize long-term usage of Galxe’s infrastructure while unlocking special perks/benefits along the way, such as gas fee credits, promotional opportunities, priority support, etc.


If you reference the below screenshot, Galxe has a clear blueprint of how a Space can level up within Galxe. Our Task Center within each project’s dashboard is designed to guide you through each tier to understand what is necessary to level up.


Galxe will make sure to incentivize quality Arbitrum Token Reward module deployments and participation by including it in the Task Center for each relevant Tier. There are two distinct ways that Galxe can encourage Arbitrum activity amongst our 3700 ecosystem partners within the Galxe Task Center.




Reward dapps that deploy steady Arbitrum Token Reward Quests.


Reward dapps that achieve consistent, high-level participation.




To make sure the grant funds go into the hands of humans AND are used to drive on-chain transactions on Arbitrum, a minimum requirement to receive the token rewards grant will be to define at least 1 on-chain action and add a Sybil prevention credential. Galxe will enforce the usage of a Sybil prevention credential throughout this program.


Galxe Passport:
 Galxe’s own KYC solution. This method allows only real, verified users to participate in Galxe campaigns. Galxe Passport has 446K+ verified users and verification is conducted by Persona.


Galxe Web3 Score:
 Prove your humanity via off-chain and on-chain verification.


Gitcoin Passport:
 Dapps can token-gate their campaigns with a customized Gitcoin Passport Score


Trusta Labs Sybil Scoring Credential
: A credential that assigns a Sybil score based on wallet history/activity using AI tech.


Nomis Score:
 Analyzes wallet activity across multiple EVM chains.


Have X amount of transactions on Arbitrum
: A wallet must have a minimum amount of transactions on Arbitrum


Hold X amount of ARB or ETH: Hold a specific number of ARB or ETH tokens in your wallet




To make it clear, achieving an increased Space Tier on Galxe is not related in any shape or form to profits that Galxe may accrue. Our Space Tier Program is determined by the quality of campaigns, the willingness to experiment with Galxe’s entire suite of growth tools and the consistent, steady use of Galxe’s infrastructure.

Lastly, Galxe will not take any portion of the funds. Funds will be used for the sole purpose of incentivizing and rewarding users with ARB through Galxe’s Token Reward module.


Grant Timeline:


Galxe plans to begin working with Arbitrum ecosystem dapps immediately following the passing of the proposal. This includes finding the best activity to track and incentivize that is relevant to each protocol


Any unused funds will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO on January 31, 2024.


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?


Yes.

Galxe is an expert at powering protocol growth and guiding users to explore different protocols. During this quest, there were no incentives available to users throughout its duration. We are thrilled to see the results when there are incentives included.


All Arbitrum protocols will be eligible to receive an incentive subsidy to kickstart their own growth via Galxe. Galxe’s Arbitrum partners have deployed 160 Arbitrum quests over the past three months. Using the requested ARB funds this will be the most inclusive questing incentive program known to the blockchain space rather than incentives only being available to select Arbitrum protocols.


All Arbitrum protocols will have the opportunity to use the ARB incentives in their Galxe campaigns. Galxe will leverage our Space Tiers to determine the subsidy amount.


This grant will kickstart and sustain ecosystem growth across the entire Arbitrum ecosystem. Currently, Galxe is the highest traffic driver on Arbitrum over the past 30 days. The main purpose of this grant is to increase traffic and give Arbitrum protocols a resource for growth via incentives.

Do You Acknowledge That Your Team Will Be Subject to a KYC Requirement?:


Yes


SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size:


59,500 $ARB


Grant Matching:


The Furucombo team will support the marketing campaigns (such as creation of the Galxe campaign), and/or development of FE/BE integrations required to support this campaign (such as showing user volume on the Furucombo interface, and tracking progress for the campaign details in real-time). All the rewards from the Arbitrum foundation will be used to incentivize users to use Furucombo on Arbitrum.


Grant Breakdown:


100% of the grant funds will go back to users who perform trading actions as part of our campaign. The main KPI for the campaign will be around volume. The more volume a user does on Furucombo, the more $ARB they can earn. We will also focus on how we can reduce sybils, or reduce the amount of people gaming the system for rewards. We want to ensure that the premise of the campaign is that people are learning the tools that Furucombo provides, and performing real trading actions on our platform to make their experience on-chain seamless and composable. Additionally, Furucombo supports the top-tier Arbitrum DeFi protocols. This means that increased volume on Furucombo adds to the growth of both our product, and the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole.

Contract Address:


josh@dinngo.co


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives:


The key objective of our campaign and application for the Arbitrum Incentive program is to incentivize users to use the features and functions of Furucombo. We want this campaign to show users how Furucombo can help make their experience on-chain more seamless and composable through using the tools that Furucombo can provide. This includes position management, either from create mode or our lending dashboard, which includes the Flashloan functionality to manage positions without any upfront funds including: debt swaps, collateral swaps, leverage, and deleverage. Additionally we can provide multi-swaps, multi-send, fiat to crypto, bridging to and from chain, and more. Through the services we provide on Arbitrum we want our users to feel more comfortable using DeFi from our easy to use interface.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):


We will look to use volume metrics to track the progress of our campaign. Users who perform transactions on Furucombo can earn back some rewards in $ARB tokens based on their volume. This incentivizes users to try out the features and functions of Furucombo and perform transactions on chain. This includes any action on furucombo, including position management (Aave, Radiant, or Compound), swap or multi-swap, multi-send, token bridging to and from chain, & more. The rewards that can be earned based on user volume is as follows:




Milestone 1: >$15,000 in traded position→ 30 $ARB


Milestone 2: >$50,000 in traded position → 110 $ARB


Milestone 3: > $100,000 traded position → 230 $ARB


Milestone 4: > $250,000 traded position → 590 $ARB


Milestone 5: >$500,000 traded position → 1180 $ARB


Milestone 6: >$1,000,000 traded position → rewards to be calculated on a user-to-user basis. We will reach out with the user directly to discuss their needs, and see how Furucombo can continue to develop a product that they will continue to use in the future.




In our previous Arbitrum Degens Party campaign (which is detailed below under execution strategy), we were able to date acquire around $3.5M in volume on Arbitrum with a cost of $5,000 in available rewards. This means, we expect that we will be able to provide about $50M in volume on the Arbitrum network with the available 59,500 $ARB tokens as requested. We believe the aforementioned milestones follow the same math as our previous campaign, and therefore justifies the requested amount to achieve our goals.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


This grant will allow us to provide an incentive to users to perform trading actions on Arbitrum. This includes any of our integrated partners, including Radiant, Stargate, Compound, Paraswap, Uniswap, and Aave. This means that any trading actions on Furucombo, also benefit our partners, and others on the Arbitrum ecosystem though increased volume, and potentially higher TVL on chain as users bridge funds to complete these trading actions. When users perform actions on-chain with Furucombo, they will experience easy and seamless trading which will result in them wanting to participate more on-chain.


Justification for the size of the grant:


We believe that this grant size is a fair amount to ask for as it can help us to garner interest in our platform, and also provide adequate rewards to our loyal users. This grant will help us to generate positive sum volume on-chain which will improve the metrics of the Arbitrum chain, and result in more trading actions and therefore more TVL in other protocols around the ecosystem.


Execution Strategy:


Once the grant has been approved, we will provide a detailed breakdown of how we will apply these resources towards our campaign. As mentioned, the main focus will be around the Volume KPI. We want to ensure that the experience is beneficial for both users and protocols, and that the campaign is also fun and fosters a positive experience. We will assign marketing resources to develop a well thought out campaign (similar to our previous 
Arbitrum Degens Party campaign
), and assign any dev resources required for creating tracking dashboards, FE/BE integration for volume or transaction tracking, etc. Our preference is to make the campaign seamless so that users don’t have to engage with a 3rd party to find the details of their rewards, but we also want to ensure we can attract both users on Arbitrum, and users from other chains that would benefit from using Furucombo on Arbitrum.


Grant Timeline:


Once the grant is confirmed, we can spring into action and setup the campaign details. This might include a campaign on Galxe, and/or details directly on the Furucombo front end on: how to participate, details of rewards accrued, details of volume processed through the proxy, etc. We expect that we will be able to run this campaign within 1-2 weeks of being approved, and we will run it till the end of the campaign period of Jan 31st.


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?:


Yes


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:


No


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?:


Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Avalanche, Fantom, & Metis


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?:


October 21st, 2022


Protocol Performance:


So far Furucombo has gained success on the Arbitrum chain. In terms of activity, Arbitrum is our 3rd highest user and volume base, slightly behind the Ethereum and Polygon chains. Currently, with the addition of the Radiant Capital protocol, we have been increasing our user and volume base. Many users appreciate the easy to use 1-click position management on our new lending dashboard page. Currently, our 30D volume on the Arbitrum chain is just over $3,000,000, many of which are position management transactions completed ethier on Radiant, Aave, or Compound. Details of this volume can be found on the Arbitrum Dune Dashboard here: 
https://dune.com/blake/furucombo-x-arbitrum
. There is also additional information of our performance located on our public Dune dashboard here: 
https://dune.com/Marcov/furucombo
.


Additionally, we are currently running an active Arbitrum Degens Party campaign (
Arbitrum Degens Party by Furucombo | Galxe
), that users can still participate in. In partnering with Radiant Capital, Fox Wallet, DODO, and OpenOcean, users can complete tasks for up to $5,000 in rewards from us and our partners. This campaign has been supported by the Arbitrum foundation, as well as Galxe. This campaign shows our dedication towards the Arbitrum ecosystem, and fosters positive growth. To date, over 565 users have participated in the Furucombo quests, 440 for Fox Wallet, 145 for DODO, 378 for OpenOcean, and 395 for Radiant. To help users complete this campaign, we have also added an extensive tutorial, and videos describing how to bridge to chain, how to swap and lend, and how to lock dLP on Radiant as an example. We are committed to bringing the best and most intuitive campaigns and protocol integrations to Arbitrum to create the best user experience. We are also committed to maintaining positive relationships with our partners, and seeing how we can continue to grow together to bolster the whole Arbitrum ecosystem.


Protocol Roadmap:


Furucombo continues to add protocols and functionality that bolsters the composability of our platform, and better supports users of DeFi on the Arbitrum network. This includes the recently added Radiant Capital to our Create mode and Lending Dashboard. We are constantly evaluating how we can work with existing protocols, and looking at ways at increasing our on-chain use cases.


Additionally, we are soon launching our open API/SDK, called 
Protocolink
, where protocols and users on the Arbitrum network can build and integrate easily with Furucombo, even without knowing how to code using our toolkit. This toolkit will work to allow anyone to be a builder and Arbitrum will be a forefront of this innovative integration. This includes use-cases such as employing flash loans to manage lending positions and execute liquidations, facilitating zap-in and zap-out, developing multi-send actions for airdrops or asset transfers, building a DEX aggregator utilizing a custom algorithm, creating an arbitrage bot, and much more!


Audit History:


Security is of utmost importance to the Furucombo Team. Our extensive list of audits can be found at 
Audit Report - Furucombo

SECTION 5: Data and Reporting


Is your team prepared to create Dune Dashboards for your incentive program?:


Yes, we can track any necessary metrics to measure progress of KPI’s and/or rewards.


Does your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread?:


Yes, we will create bi-weekly reporting to update the community and foundation on the status of our campaign and grant.


Does your team acknowledge that failure to comply with any of the above requests can result in the halting of the program’s funding stream?:


Yes


We thank you for taking the time to read our proposal and consider us for this amazing chance to show our product to the Arbitrum ecosystem, and give back to our users that have trusted us and our product. We hope that you see the value in what we propose, and that we can continue to foster growth for this amazing ecosystem.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size:


1.2M ARB = 150,000 ARB per 2 week tranche for 16 weeks.


It seems that far more than the 50M $ARB has been requested by various grants.  Upon analysis of the asks and programs presented, we feel our current ask is reasonable.

The program/automation specified here can function with any amount of $ARB really, and we are happy to take part in a process of normalizing the ask between grants.   We would ask potential grantees and delegates to try to keep it focused on the good of the Arbitrum Ecosystem and avoid being overly competitive through any such process


Grant Breakdown:


The purpose of this grant is to augment economic activity on Arbitrum by building an autonomous mechanism for distributing incentives in the form of ARB to boost all Balancer liquidity across the Arbitrum network. There are certain criteria that boosts certain asset classes and pool types depending on the composition and surrounding integrations of particular pools.


Balancer has already initiated this 
incentive program
 using the ARB allocated during the original DAO airdrop. The nature of the automated incentives program proposed for this initiative is as follows


There is a pool of 40,000 ARB weekly to augment incentives on Balancer Arbitrum pools.


Each pool is given a weighting that is determined by the following metrics:




Each pool gets a base value depending on how much veBAL vote weight the pool has


An additional dynamic multiplier is applied based on the revenue generated from said pool


An additional static multiplier is applied based on the category of the pool, with the categories defined below




Balancer Pool with veBAL Voting Weight: 1x


This is the base number dependent on the total vote weight for a particular pools gauge and will serve as the base for the below multipliers


Pool Efficiency: 1-3x


This multiplier is dependent on the amount of revenue a pool has earned relative to the BAL emitted to it. This makes sure that pools that perform well relative to the incentives it has will be rewarded with extra incentives.


This is calculated as feesEarned/(value of bal emitted + 1)


—


Ecosystem Integrations: 1.5x


Pools with >500k of TVL deposited through external protocols such as Pendle style yield splitting, money markets using pool tokens as collateral, and other partner integrations.


Core Infra: 1.75x


Pools that serve as a core piece of infrastructure, such as stablecoin pairs, LST pairs, and 8020 governance systems.


New and Novel AMM types: 2x


For non-Balancer created custom pool types built upon Balancer that demonstrate an innovative approach to AMM design. This includes Gyro E-CLP pools and Xave FX pools.  New AMMs may be moved from New and Novel to one of the other 2 categories after an initial period of extra boost to help highlight new tech.


—


Note, a pool can only get one of the above 3 multipliers, whichever is highest, and is applied additively along with the pool efficiency multiplier. The max multiplier for a pool is 3x, and any multiplier above 3x will be rounded down to 3. Individual pools are capped at 10% of weekly ARB distributions, with the exception of LST pools which are capped at 20%.


Each pool then gets its share of the 63,750 weekly ARB directly added as secondary incentives on the gauge according to their relative total weighting determined by the above factors.


Additionally, 11,250 ARB will be used to incentivize Core liquidity, specifically the USD 4pool and wstETH/4pool each week. This, along with our deep wstETH/weth liquidity, will allow us to route between all major stables, weth, and wstETH. The list of pools is subject to change.


Finally, note that the reasons for boost and multipliers as well as fixed allocations may be changed by Balancer governance. We welcome members of the Arbitrum Community to come talk to us about ideas/suggestions they have on how to adopt the program and/or to bring governance around these changes.

Arbitrum veBAL voting: 
Balancer


$ARB will be sent by the LM Multisig into the $ARB Injector contract on a biweekly basis as funds become available.  The payload to send these funds will include a payload that configures the injector to distribute funds to various Balacer Pools through our gauge system and based on veBAL voting.  The injector will then maintain a steady stream of these funds for a 2 week period.


Funding from the injector will flow to a dynamic set of veBAL gauges based on veBAL voting so a specific list of addresses can not be provided.   The table below includes links to all of the current gauge addresses that would receive funds should they be paid out based on voting over the last 2 weeks.


Gauges accept Balancer Liquidty Pool tokens (BPTs) as deposits, and emit rewards based on deposits.  Gauges can be added to the BAL emissions system following a 
governance process
.


ARB emissions for this program are directed based on signal voting by veBAL holders, which take effect weekly at 00:00 GMT on Thursday.   Once the program begins, new CSV files that describe the exact amounts payed in a human readable fashion will be created by each bi-weekly automation run in this 
GitHub Repo
 or one similar to it.  The Dune Dashboard will also provide detailed information on where $ARB as well as other reward tokens are flowing and how it changes over time.


This program provides a way for DAOs who were not able to directly participants in this program to benefit from additional ARB incentives, as well as Balancers native emissions and $AURA emissions provided when using 
Aura Finance
.  We warmly invite DAOs looking for liquidity to touch base via our 
Discord
 for help configuring optimal liquidty, working through the governance process and understand the economics of it all.


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives:


Ease the Cost of Liquidity to Ecosystem Projects


Liquidity is an extremely important aspect for projects to thrive. We hope by augmenting Balancer pools on Arbitrum, we can cheapen the cost of liquidity to all projects on Arbitrum looking for a home for liquidity.


Deepen Core Liquidity on Arbitrum


It is essential for many DeFi applications, primarily money markets, to have deep liquidity for protocol liquidations. We hope that this grant will result in this liquidity to be usable across the thriving Arbitrum Defi ecosystem for major assets and LST’s.


Foster Innovation in the AMM Space


We have observed projects have great success by building their custom AMM’s on top of Balancer flexible architecture and we hope to encourage more projects to build out AMM’s to suit their needs.


Increased Adoption


We are determined to further drive the adoption of Arbitrum on Balancer as a major part of the ecosystem.


Our primary objectives for this grant are therefore:




Extend the length and size of the currently running program


Demonstrate to the Arbitrum DAO, Foundation and Ecosystem that Balancer is a measured and responsible DAO with deep experience in incentive management.


Increase the number of pools and projects using Balancer and veBAL to host liquidity.


Ensure that we’re not left behind as other DEXs receive large grants that give them an outsized advantage.


Increase LSD liquidity on Arbitrum and introduce wstETH as a viable pairing token for better returns for LPs.




Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):




Number of projects participating in the program


BAL emissions flowing towards pools on Arbitrum (absolute / %)


Number of pools participating in the program (receiving votes from veBAL)




What Balancer has done with the Arbitrum DAO Airdrop:


Of the circa 3 million ARB awarded to Balancer in the initial airdrop, 2 million was deposited into a liquidity pool with equal parts AURA and BAL. The remaining 1 million was allocated towards matching bribes placed by DAOs to support Arbitrum liquidity. You can see the previous distributions per pool 
here
.


Since then, we have spent more time thinking about this system, and created an automated system to allocate a fixed amount of ARB per week to pools there based on veBAL voting. 
BIP-429
 describes how this program will function with funding of 40,000 ARB per week and provides some example data for the last voting round given these parameters. The automated vote-based nature of the system ensures alignment between the protocol and LPs, as pool incentives flow to their respective pools based on transparent on-chain votes.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


New Arbitrum protocols need liquidity to launch and succeed. This grant/program will allow economically intelligent builders to build very cost effective liquidity natively on the Arbitrum network.


Justification for the size of the grant:


As this grant comes to fruition, many DEXes will be able to offer higher yields. It is important that Balancer can remain competitive as the second largest DEX for Arbitrum TVL. For this reason, we invite the size of our grant to be adjusted to be in line with other grants offered to DEXes in order to create a fair playing field.


The current program running on our airdrop with 40k ARB per week is starting to gain traction, but is planned to end around November 3rd.


Balancer currently emits a total of 121,929 BAL (about 400k USD) per week. We believe this program will help direct more emissions into the Arbitrum ecosystem. We believe the described mechanism to be great for aligning Arbitrum ecosystem projects with Balancer and the greater community which benefits from deep on-chain liquidity native to the Arbitrum network.


Example numbers based on the current situation:


Here is an example of how 200000 ARB (based on our original ask) would be distributed had it been distributed between 07 September - 21 September, 2023.   A new table for the  most recent 2 week epoch, distributing 150,000 $ARB over 2 weeks will be provided in the comments of the Forum before the end of Friday October 6th.

Total ARB Requested:


1.2M


BAL per week required at current pricing for 1/1 matching:


If the program started today 7582($24,800) BAL would be flowing to match 75,000 ARB($66,000).

In program incentives follow voting which produces BAL emissions.  The idea is that this will create competition for rewards increasing the amount of BAL emitted while the ARB remains fixed.


We expect the boost in ROI provided by the $ARB rewards to encourage more fee recycling and external voting and thereby increase BAL and AURA.    It will likely take a number of 2 week epochs before the results can be fully understood.


Execution Strategy:


See github for more details, code, and results: 
https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/data_automation/blob/main/notebooks/arb_dao_grant_distribution/dao_grant.ipynb

In summary, here is how it works.




Every 2 weeks the script is run to ARB distribution based on current veBAL voting.



A json payload files for the Balancer LM Multisig on ARB to configure the rewards injector with these values.






The ARB Rewards Injector
 pays the amounts configured out such that it creates a consistent stream of rewards on the gauge.



The 2 week amount is split into 2 weekly injections which stream alongside AURA and BAL to depositors in the gauge.



Each new week of ARB injections when the last one finished and there is sufficient funding for the currently configured program.






The Rewards injector must always have sufficient funding for the next week to operate.


The Tokens in the rewards injector can be swept by LM Multisig.


Fund tranches will be claimed biweekly by Hedgey and sent to the injector along with a distribution schedule output by the automation described above.








Grant Timeline:


The funds will start being distributed within 15 days of the receipt of the first payment. The program will continue until all ARB is spent 16 weeks later.  The LM Multisig is an operational multisig that can act reasonably quickly.  It will work to try to ensure that rewards are claimed and schedules are loaded in sufficient time to prevent any gaps in emissions.


Funding Tranches:


Funding will be delivered in biweekly Tranches via Hedgey.  The LM Multisig will handle claiming these tranches and funding/configuring the injector, which will facilitate a 2 week steady flow of funds.


The LM Multisig will execute the first time between 8 and 13 days after the first Tranche become available.  This will allow a solid buffer to prevent tight time windows between 2 biweekly schedules.

SECTION 5: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Provide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:


Although Balancer was first launched on Ethereum, it was one of the first DeFi protocols to deploy on Arbitrum. Arbitrum is Balancer’s second largest network in terms of TVL and as one of the first movers to deploy on Arbitrum, it is now sitting at 2nd largest DEX by TVL behind Uniswap. With the investment of being a first mover to the ecosystem, and long time focus for the protocols business development strategies, Arbitrum is a key pillar in Balancer’s success now and in the future.


The 
Dune Plot
 below shows Emissions flows and Volume to Arbitrum.  Clear growth can be shown in 2023. Notable events were the launch 
Radiant’s ve80/20 program
 on  March 19th, and the start of the 
Airdrop Incentives Program
 on June 26th:


image
2000×729 198 KB


Balancer has been working with partners like Chainlink, 1inch, Lido, Rocketpool, Coinbase, Swell and others to create a robust LST ecosystem on Arbitrum with the goal of starting a movement focused on LST eth pairings for governance tokens and other uncorrelated token liquidity. To emphasize this point, the near term future will include utilizing Gyro-ECLPS to further increase the efficiency of LST liquidity. This is a dominant concentrated liquidity model, only offered via Balancer.


Balancers main pillar for growth on Arbitrum so far has been our unique offerings surrounding LST stableswaps.   Further real growth for Balancer come from projects succeeding using Balancers tech, such as the Radiant launch on Arbitrum. These success are catalysts that spin up all our various flywheels and create excitement and engagement in the greater ecosystem.


BAL emissions are distributed in a decentralized way, and Balancer contributors have limited means to affect voting.  Unlike many other DEXes applying here, we have chosen not to have direct control over emissions flows.


This program, combined with some engagement efforts should give us the ability to create more catalysts without offering special BD incentive deals to specific DAOs, which we generally try to avoid.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?:


Balancer is currently deployed on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, Polygon zkEVM, Gnosis Chain, Base, Avalanche, and Optimism in a shared deployment with BeethovenX.


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?:


The Balancer Vault was first deployed on Arbitrum on August 24th, 2021. See the transaction 
here

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size:


2,000,000 ARB


Grant Matching:


Synapse will match the grant fully as well as continue to provide liquidity mining rewards on Arbitrum. In the past year, Synapse has supported the Arbitrum ecosystem with 4M+ SYN($3M+).


Grant Breakdown: [Please provide a high-level overview of the budget breakdown and planned use of funds]


This grant’s aim is to achieve two primary objectives:






Slippage-free bridging - 1.5M ARB will be used to support faster and cheaper bridging. Using Synapse’s concentrated liquidity pools and traditional stableswap pools, Synapse’s aim is for any Arbitrum user to bridge up to $5M slippage-free. Concentrated liquidity bridging is similar to going from Uni V2 to Uni V3, allowing slippage-free bridging. This will massively improve Arbitrum’s UX, lowering costs for users and incentivizing users to bring their assets in from other chains.






Support Arbitrum partners - Synapse is the native bridge partner for many Arbitrum tokens including GMX, FRAX, OHM, VSTA, SDT etc. 500k ARB will be used to support these projects and their users bridging to Arbitrum. Users bridging partner tokens to Arbitrum as well as new tokens launching on Arbitrum will receive gas & fee rebates.






To date, Synapse has facilitated $8B in volume across 700k transactions and 200k wallets on Arbitrum, bringing billions of dollars of stablecoins and other assets to Arbitrum. Additionally, Synapse is the native bridge for over a dozen projects including GMX, FRAX, etc to allow their users to bridge their tokens to Arbitrum.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives: [Clearly state the primary objectives of the grant and what you intend to achieve]




Encourage new $$ into the Arbitrum ecosystem. With concentrated liquidity, Arbitrum will be the only L2 to have slippage-free bridging from any chain. We expect this grant to bring $3B net new dollars into the ecosystem.


Support & grow existing Arbitrum projects. Today, Synapse is the native bridge for GMX and dozens of other Arbitrum native projects. By subsidizing gas & fee costs associated with bridging these tokens, more users and developers will be encouraged to join the ecosystem.


According to DefiLama, 45% of Synapse TVL is on Ethereum and 40% is on Arbitrum today. We anticipate Arbitrum to dominate Synapse TVL and reach 70%.




Between a large cross-chain user base and innovative cross-chain technology, the goal is to bring new users, assets, and dollars into the Arbitrum ecosystem. This is accomplished through Fast bridging for users up to $5m, Supporting existing Arbitrum Protocols, and Encouraging new users and developers.


Fast bridging through Concentrated Liquidity is a new paradigm that will expedite the bridging process and make bridging more affordable. Success in this initiative includes attracting liquidity, shorter bridge times, and volume through the new pools.


Support for existing Arbitrum protocols is focused around initiatives that encourage users to cross-pollinate protocols on the chain. Gas rebates & fee rebates will support projects and their users.


The objectives here follow the tailwinds of current Synapse efforts in the Arbitrum ecosystem Synapse has already facilitated nearly $8bn of volume, ~200k users and 700k transactions on the L2 and is uniquely positioned to bring new dollars into the Arbitrum ecosystem and direct them to key protocols.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): [Specify the KPIs that will be used to measure success in achieving the grant objectives]


Some milestones are:




Improve Bridge Quotes: Slippage free, instant bridging on up to $5m through Concentrated Liquidity


Deeper Liquidity Pools: $60m in TVL on synapse stableswap pools


Increase assets on Arbitrum, we anticipate this grant will drive $3B of net new volume(based on existing incentives) on Arbitrum




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?: [Provide details]


Synapse Protocol expects to foster growth and innovation from the grant through two key mechanisms: Making it easier to get assets onto the chain, and improving the cross-chain experience through partnerships in the ecosystem.


The first goal is to make it easier to bridge assets into the ecosystem, this means cheaper, faster, safer, and more user friendly bridging. Concentrated Liquidity is a novel way to enable slippage-free, fast bridging for anything under $5m. Cheap and fast bridging is crucial for increasing the amount of dollars that enter the ecosystem. Beyond new bridging models and subsidizing liquidity, creative ways to encourage old and new users are from gas airdrops to subsidized fees, which will help to funnel liquidity and users into the Arbitrum Ecosystem.


The second goal is to build deeper integrations and tooling with existing Arbitrum projects. Synapse already has key strategic integrations within the ecosystem: the native bridge for GMX, core integrations with Uniswap, Balancer, Olympus DAO, and Frax. Further tying cross-chain support into decentralized applications, in a way that is intuitive, encourages the use of new applications in the ecosystem.


Justification for the size of the grant: [Enter explanation]


Synapse is eligible for the Pinnacle grant:




Has been live on Arbitrum for 22 months


Has $40M in TVL on Arbitrum




Deploying shortly after mainnet launched, Synapse was one of the first protocols to arrive on the chain, and to date has facilitated $8bn of volume, ~200k users and 700k transactions.


Synapse also has made a strong effort to create deep integrations with top tier Arbitrum projects, serving as the native bridge partner for GMX, and bespoke integrations with 4 more of the top 10 TVL projects on the chain.


Execution Strategy: [Describe the plan for executing including resources, products, use of funds, and risk management. This includes allocations for specific pools, eligible assets, products, etc.]


The execution plan is to deploy liquidity emissions and gas/fee rebates as the streamed ARB comes in.


Smart contracts to stream these funds will be developed by contributors to the Synapse DAO and the contracts will be managed by the Synapse DAO.


Grant Timeline: [Describe the timeline for the grant]


The timeline for the grant is Q4 2023. Deployment of funds into initiatives would begin soon after the grant.

SECTION 1: APPLICANT INFORMATION


Applicant Name:
 Sanko GameCorp


Project Name:
 Sanko Dream Machine


Project Description: The Sanko Dream Machine is a multimedia-focused infrastructure protocol and suite of games hosted natively on Arbitrum. Sanko GameCorp is fully community-driven and independently supported without VC funding.


Sanko GameCorp’s upcoming Arbitrum Orbit Chain will be a hub for on-chain activity across social media and gaming.


Live streaming has exploded in popularity in recent years and there is high confluence in the user demographics of streaming, gaming, and crypto. Existing streaming platforms suppress streamer earnings by taking up to 50% of tipping revenue. SankoTV aims to gain market share by significantly increasing the share of earnings for streamers and viewers while offering additional earning opportunities in the form of SankoTV Passes – a SocialFi mechanic analogous to keys in Friend Tech. Each streamer can elect to set a price in their unique Pass to view a particular stream or to give the ability to watch or chat based on the number of Passes a viewer holds. In addition to Passes, SankoTV integrates Friend Tech keys themselves – keys will have the same functionality as Passes and allow people to use Base based assets to transact in meaningful ways on Arbitrum. We expect this app to increase user metrics and volume on Arbitrum, comparable to social app activity on Base.


The Dream Machine currently features five fully developed games: McAfee’s Main Event, ¡Sanko!, Miya, Sakura Pinball, and Milady Tekken. The Sanko GameCorp team has multiple games in development slated for the launch of its Orbit Chain, including Sankoscape, a crypto-native MMORPG with integrated DEX and NFT trading, action-adventure games Sakura Park and Streets of Milady, and additional games of skill. In addition to games deployed by the Sanko team, independent web3 game developers will also be able to deploy their titles on The Dream Machine.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives:


Sanko GameCorp intends to become the premiere web3 streaming service and gaming platform by introducing novel means of financialization to in-game and attention economies.


SankoTV represents a significant opportunity in streaming as an on-chain use case with clear advantages over incumbent platforms:




Through participation incentives, viewers are rewarded for contributing to streamers in ways not possible in web2 streaming platforms.


Streamers retain the lion’s share of the revenue they generate.


Streamers earn trading revenue from their Passes and increased flexibility over how viewers engage with their content.


Viewers earn points for tipping their favorite streamers and benefit from their success via passes.




Sanko GameCorp’s primary objective for the grant is to attract crypto-native streamers and their audiences to SankoTV. Providing incentives to early adopters of SankoTV would serve to accomplish the following objectives:




Onboarding streamers and users to the platform at launch, increasing the amount of content generated on SankoTV and the likelihood of achieving virality early on.


Increase attention on Sanko GameCorp products to increase the user base for forthcoming releases.


Establish Arbitrum as the home for the first viable on-chain streaming economy.




Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):


SankoTV grant KPIs will focus on the increase in users of the platform and the value generated from tipping and Pass trading:




Daily active streamers


Daily active viewers


Daily tip value


Daily SankoTV Pass volume


Revenue generated from Pass trading




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:




Establishing Arbitrum as the home for on-chain streaming.






The broader crypto ecosystem lacks user-facing applications.


Given the global popularity of streaming and crypto’s heavily attention-based economy, SankoTV is well-positioned to capitalize on the budding SocialFi sector.


Streaming appeals to web2 users – creating consumer-facing applications that cater to newcomers as well as crypto natives will add to Arbitrum’s reputation as the home for innovative tech by onboarding new users to the ecosystem.






Drive adoption and demonstrate the potential of Arbitrum Orbit to host novel applications.






Driving attention and adoption to the deployment of the first multimedia Arbitrum Orbit Chain would serve as a successful proof of concept for the technology and a significant win for the broader ecosystem.


On-chain streaming and on-chain MMORPGs have yet to be executed successfully – using incentives to jumpstart adoption would help ensure that Arbitrum is the home of the first viable example of these applications.


SankoTV’s addition of SocialFi mechanics and unique NFT tipping make it the first streaming platform of its kind.


The integration of Friend Tech keys allows users to transact in meaningful ways on Arbitrum using assets from Base chain.






Differentiate Arbitrum from competitors as a hub for original content.






Viral content originating from an Arbitrum-native application would effectively establish Arbitrum in the zeitgeist beyond niche crypto circles.




Justification for the size of the grant:


Sanko GameCorp meets the requirements for the Siren ARB grant:




Deployed to Arbitrum mainnet in May 2023


TVL of > $4M


$13M 30-day trading volume


$10M in Main Event volume since inception


1.4k players since inception


217k games played since inception




Execution Strategy:


500K ARB rewards will be distributed to SankoTV streamers and viewers at the end of the first rewards season on December 31, 2023. The grant will be allocated to SankoTV users using a points system that is updated weekly to keep users engaged for the duration of the incentives period and ensure that they engage in good faith. Points will be awarded for performing on-chain interactions, including SankoTV Pass trading, gift-giving, and hosting popular streams in terms of gifts received and viewership metrics. Points will also be awarded to users who issue referral links to others who engage with the protocol by trading SankoTV Passes and streamers with top-value Passes by market cap each week.


At the end of the incentives period, ARB rewards will be distributed based on the user’s portion of points relative to the total amount of points distributed. For example, a user that has accrued 1% of the total points distributed will be rewarded with 1% of the ARB in the rewards pool, a user that has accrued 0.5% of the total points distributed will be rewarded with 0.5% of the ARB rewards pool, and so on.

SECTION 1: APPLICANT INFORMATION


Project Name
: Tide


Project Description
: Tide helps web3 businesses distribute incentives in a data driven way.


Every web3 business adopts token distribution and direct user incentives as a growth strategy. Most of the proposals for STIP are indeed budget request for liquidity mining programs.


However, liquidity mining can be hugely improved:




It is not data driven, making it easy for sybil and short term speculator to profit. Ideally this programs should be designed to attract effectively the best users


It is not optimized for engagement. Users are not (only) looking for better APR. Including mechanics popular in games such as reward randomization can boost campaigns by 10x


It is not sybil protected. There is a huge discrepancy between real daily active users and airdrops / quest participants. We need ways to boost human participation




Tide wants to solve these problems and has already relevant traction (and paying customers) in web3 (worked with the likes of LIFI, socket, 1inch, NFTperp).


Moreover, tide team recently joined the an incubation program sponsored by a US blue-chip company as it is looking to bring quest-based marketing to the broader web2 market. The announcement of this partnership will be next week.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives
: Grant will all be used to incentivize users’ participation in the various campaigns related to the Arbitrum Ecosystem. Up to now, incentives have often been misallocated, especially when involving quests based campaigns. Below we describe how Tide can ensure to reward authentic and engaged users only.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
: [Specify the KPIs that will be used to measure success in achieving the grant objectives]




250k New active users (with no previous arbitrum transactions)


100+ campaigns


Integration of quest widget and SDK in 5+ projects


Grant of 40k OP to distribute tokens




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
:


Tide can help the Arbitrum ecosystem acquire and retain users with a new approach. The relatively small size of the grant can help us running A/B tests in quests and develop more sustainable ways to incentivize users in web3.


The grant will be used to fund a program of campaigns mainly focused on incentivizing on-chain activity and only 
accessible to relevant wallets based on their on-chain history
 . Each Tide campaign releases tokens (raffles and First come first served), NFT or souldbound rewards.


Tide program will feature some key differentiators:




Allowlists:
 Campaigns will be accessible only to users with a relevant on-chain history to mitigate bots and make sure authentic users are onboarded. (e.g. active users, advanced dex users, lending protocol users).

1205×647 74.4 KB






Gitcoin passport
 Integrating minimum gitcoin score allows to have more relevant users and to expand the campaigns reach






On-chain actions:
 The goal is to bring direct value to Arbitrum dApps and on-chain activity is the best way to do it. With Tide, it’s possible to automatically monitor any on-chain event (e.g Deposit 1000$ for 30 days in a pool, perform X swaps ) with no-coding requirements. Sophisticated on-chain tasks will also make sure only interested users will participate and further reduce interaction of bots). Projects are already building on-chain action quest themselves






image
921×638 54.3 KB




Analytics suite:
 Our analytics and performance suite will be used to understand the impact of the campaigns & the kind of users that are participating. With this information, it will be easier to iterate on the campaigns and adjust them to maximize their efficiency.




image
922×665 50.7 KB




Social actions:
 Tide support tracking of twitter and discord engagement to merge web3 activity with web2 social




The program be held in partnership with various projects of various size (Pendle, Unstoppable, 1inch, Socket, Magpie, Lyra).


Justification for the size of the grant
: We request a relatively small grant to show positive results and iterate on next grant cycles. The average campaign size with ERC20 rewards is 1k $, as we are working with 10-15 projects over a 4 months period, we  aim to do at least 50 campaigns.

Campaign example:




Allowlist: of polygon, op users not active on arbitrum. Bridge at least 1k on arbitrum via socket. Get raffle tickets for 1k ARB tokens


Allowlist: Gitcoin holders, telegram quest bot users. Swap on 1inch or Uniswap on Arbitrum


Allowlist: perpetual protocols users with no past GMX experience. Open a Gmx position


Allowlist: relevant twitter accounts. Task: retweet and reply  to campaign post. Get rewarded based on number of followers




All campaign will be displayed in a whitelabel branded space for Arbitrum.


Execution Strategy
:

The grant will be used over a 
4 months
 period to create innovative on-chain campaigns to drive usage and traffic to the Arbitrum ecosystem.


Grant Timeline
: We can get started 1 month after receiving the first funds


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?
 Yes


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?
: No. Arbitrum was the first chain we deployed to and where we had some of our most successful campaigns (NFTperp, Arbitrum Odissey v2)


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size
: 7,000,000 
$ARB


Grant Matching
: 100,000 
$GNS


Grant Breakdown






Trading Incentives (85%):
 6,000,000 
$ARB
 for our custom trading points system. Rewards various productive behaviors, such as trading high volume, trading well (positive PnL), being consistent and loyal, etc. Flows back to the Arbitrum ecosystem as traders are rewarded for their active participation. Described in more detail in Section 3.






Liquidity Incentives (15%):
 1,000,000 
$ARB
 (+100,000 
$GNS
).


Consists of collaborating with DEXes, Chainlink, lending platforms, and others to promote sustainable liquidity for 
$GNS
 and 
$gTokens
 (such as 
$gDAI
). The ability for our tokens to be easily tradable with size and used as collateral on several Lending Protocols integrates them deeper into the Arbitrum ecosystem and creates positive feedback loops. Additionally, more gTokens liquidity helps entering and exiting our vaults without going through the regular withdrawal timelock, making it easier to gain new TVL in our vaults. Finally, these incentives will directly flow back into the Arbitrum ecosystem as they directly incentivize the usage of various Arbitrum DEXes and lending platforms.






Funding Address
: 0xC0eCc613f6F5e979Ed0169Bf7Af50803E7072e16


Funding Address Characteristics
: 4/6 community multisig with each key stored in a hardware wallet.


Contract Address
: N/A (each week, trading incentives will be sent directly from our multi-sig to users using a multi-send tool, and liquidity incentives will be sent to DEXes/lending platforms)


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives
:




Grow volume and daily unique traders on gTrade to position Arbitrum as a key infrastructure for decentralized derivatives.


Improve liquidity for our protocol token and vault tokens by supporting the usage of Arbitrum DEXes and lending platforms.


Increase our gTokens TVL to allow even bigger position sizes and maximum open interests on gTrade.




Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
:




Daily Volume:
 Increase 30-day moving average of daily volume on gTrade to $80m+ (currently $46m) with the help of trading points incentives.


Daily Unique Traders:
 Increase 30-day moving average of daily active traders to 400+ (currently 199) by attracting new users and increasing retention.


$GNS and $gTokens liquidity:
 Double $GNS and $gDAI liquidity on Arbitrum (currently $1.2m for $GNS and $200k for $gDAI across all Uniswap v3 pairs) using strategic incentives on important liquidity pools.


gTokens TVL:
 Given the targeted increase in volume, which results in increased fees going to the 
$gToken
 vaults (such as 
$gDAI
), we target a TVL increase for our vaults to $27m+ (currently $22m).




Please note that although higher TVL in our $gToken vaults contributes to bigger position sizes, this is currently not a bottleneck. We’re far from reaching the maximum volume we can handle with the current TVL due to our very high liquidity efficiency and our substantial over-collateralization layer (currently worth $4m). Therefore this is only a secondary objective.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
:


This grant is a significant catalyst for short-term growth and sustained growth of gTrade, one of the core platforms having achieved product-market fit in the Arbitrum ecosystem. Some protocols on Arbitrum such as gTrade have reached a point where they can start competing against centralized platforms. One of the main reasons mass adoption is not there yet is due to a lack of marketing and education about self-custody and transparent trading execution. While we are working on our own marketing & education efforts, making it a no-brainer to try protocols such as gTrade with the help of incentives temporarily removes this obstacle. It gives a chance to new users who wouldn’t have otherwise made the effort to try a new platform to learn about DeFi products such as gTrade, try them, and enter the Arbitrum ecosystem. We anticipate that a significant proportion of these new users will not only stay for the long term but also share the platform with other traders they know, leading to sustained growth over the long term.


Justification for the size of the grant
:


gTrade is already one of the top protocols in terms of Volume and Revenue in the Arbitrum Ecosystem. Given our current and projected weekly volume and trading fees, we strongly believe the size of the grant is justified to achieve the next growth phase. A lower grant would not be as significant compared to even our current weekly fees of about $140k (and they are much lower than usual, like most perps), which means at best it would refund fees for our existing traders only. Additionally, the points incentives system rewards genuine and organic trading activity and completely prevents any form of wash trading through a cap on volume points. Finally, we believe gTrade is highly competitive in terms of UX (self-custody, guaranteed execution, median spot prices, high number of pairs, 1-click trading, lowest latency possible, excellent UI, etc.) and therefore believe we are well positioned to retain a high proportion of the incentivized volume so that it benefits the adoption of the Arbitrum ecosystem in the long run.

More details on the point system:


Users earn points as they trade on the platform. All points reset at the start of each week except for loyalty points, which can accumulate over the whole period. The exact weights for each type of point are to be determined. Weights can also vary as we can, for example, decide to increase the weight of skill points for one particular week to generate more engagement, like a trading contest.




Loyalty Points:




Encouraging daily engagement is essential to optimize user retention.






Skill Points:




Rewarding traders based on their PnL is one of the best ways to incentivize organic and genuine trading activity.






Volume Points:




Incentivizing volume directly contributes to the primary goal of this proposal. Pairs that cost more fees to trade on will generate more volume points for the user to prevent farming points on lower-cost pairs such as forex. Finally, the rewards of this category are capped at the weekly fees generated by the platform to ensure traders are not getting paid to generate volume, therefore preventing wash trading. Rewards above the cap are redirected to other point categories, proportionally to their weights.






Diversity Points:




Encouraging traders to trade on different asset classes and explore them can lead to more robust trading volume in the long run, as there is always an interesting asset class to trade on at any point in time.

SECTION 1: GRANT INFORMATION


Applicant Name:

Ramses Exchange


Project Name:

Ramses


Project Description:

Ramses combines incentives with concentrated liquidity (CL) to provide a unique model amongst other liquidity bootstrapping solutions and DEXs across the DeFi landscape.


Specifically, Ramses enables veRAM holders (majority of which are Arbitrum protocols) to direct emissions in a decentralized manner, and collect fees from CL positions in addition to traditional AMM pools. The result of combining incentives with competitive distribution is unrivaled capital efficiency producing a 5x improvement in volume-to-tvl and the lowest possible slippage in DeFi. It is hard to overstate the long-term impact this public good will have on Arbitrum builders.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size:
 1,248,000 ARB – any unused will be returned to the DAO.


Grant Matching:

Yes.


Ramses will match up to 1,000,000 RAM weekly in the form of xoRAM to foster sustainable ecosystem growth.


Grant Breakdown:


After thoughtful discussions with delegates and the voices in the community, we are adjusting our STIP to adopt a model similar to that of other AMMs.  This decision ensures there is continuity and clarity, and eliminates any potential confusion for the short-term nature of this program.  We are grateful for the insights and guidance that have led us to this positive adjustment.


To be clear - LP’s will now be the only recipients of ARB incentives.


104,000 ARB/Epoch


- 50% of ARB allocated as direct LP incentives for concentrated liquidity pairs, with a focus on ARB pairings, key ecosystem participants, and blue-chips
- 50% of ARB allocated as direct LP incentives matched to fees generated on the pair by the end of the prior epoch. *Epoch N-1 fees will be matched with ARB distributed to Epoch N liquidity providers. This has a global cap of up to 52,000 ARB/Epoch, and RAM will be used to match these (up to 1,000,000/epoch).*



Funding Address:

Ramses Multisig– 0x20d630cf1f5628285bfb91dfac8c89eb9087be1a

Presented via Dune dashboard sourced from verifiable on-chain data via Defillama




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:

*New projects need resources to quickly and efficiently bootstrap initial liquidity, while existing protocols need to sustain and grow their liquidity at minimal cost. This grant will enable Ramses to onboard and sustain new projects in the Arbitrum ecosystem which will help drive innovation and overall growth.


Justification for the size of the grant:

Ramses has the infrastructure and partners in place to leverage the requested grant size efficiently to rapidly attract sustainable TVL from Mainnet and other chains.


Ramses operates as an extension of Arbitrum itself, augmenting the economic engine of $ARB incentives with $RAM as well as the business development / onboarding arms of the Foundation, rapidly accelerating ecosystem growth and sustainability. As required by this incentive framework, zero $ARB will be used for operations or to compensate team members and instead, 100% of the funds will be used to support ecosystem positive partner protocols building sustainable projects on Arbitrum.


Arbitrum incentives on Ramses are basically a 2-3x multiplier of liquidity incentives - including grants - for the ecosystem at large, making it easier for protocols to onboard onto Arbitrum and cheaper for them to operate, resulting in lower burn rates for $ARB and the project’s native tokens as compared to direct LP incentives. On Ramses, protocols create revenue-positive liquidity programs that will sustain them and the ecosystem at large for years to come.


Execution Strategy:


Arbitrum incentives on Ramses make it easier for protocols to onboard onto Arbitrum and cheaper for them to operate, resulting in lower burn rates for the project’s native tokens. On Ramses, protocols create revenue-positive liquidity programs that will sustain them and the ecosystem at large for years to come.


Execution Strategy:


Method of Distribution


The ARB will stream over each epoch (7 days) via RAMSES’ Concentrated Liquidity Rewarder (Gauges). This implementation has the following advantages to regular, and off-chain solutions:




NO staking involved, no custody or approval given to any contracts to participate in earning ARB


Permissionless, any user can deposit LP Incentives via the Incentivize page on the dAPP.


Fully on-chain and verifiable. There is no trust or off-chain computation required, it is all calculated within the contracts themselves.




The ARB will be distributed at the beginning of each epoch, thus streaming out over the next 7 days linearly to all active market makers proportional to their efficiency.


A non-exhaustive list of pools which already exist and could fall in-line with eligibility can be found on the liquidity dashboard at: 
R A M S E S
 as well as on the analytics dashboard(s): 
RAMSES CL Analytics


An existing implementation example of our 
RamsesV2Gauge
 contracts can be reviewed at: 
GaugeV2 | Address 0x80c4f687b81d77b33c6e3e572e2e80dccc996733 | Arbiscan


Fee matching will be done by taking the fees generated by a pool in the prior epoch (N-1) and distributing the equivalent (up to the global cap) in ARB via RAMSES gauges in the current epoch (N). The statistics will be sourced from many places, such as our in-house analytics page(s), dune dashboards, as well as any other scripts/on-chain verification methods to provide accurate information.


Grant Timeline:


Grants will be distributed weekly (per epoch), until the end of the S.T.I.P. cut-off at the end of January.


Fund Streaming:

Yes, the Ramses team believes in accountability and is happy to oblige by all discretionary actions made by the grant distribution multisig.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives:


Objective of this receiving grant will be to focus the growth of the products built on the Thales protocol to the Arbitrum Network via providing the best trading and participating environment due to sustainable ARB and THALES token incentives and rebates. With received Optimism grants giving us the experience on how grant incentives can provide sustainable growth and user retention to a specific network, we wish to see Arbitrum instances of Thales products reach the same KPIs and be on-par with other network deployments.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Key performance indicators to look out for to gauge growth of Thales products on Arbitrum would be the overall increase in Daily Active Users and Daily Volume using the Arbitrum deployments of ThalesAMM, SportsAMM and the SpeedMarketsAMM.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


With Thales products being easy-to-understand, simple and fun, they are a perfect onboarding tool for a wider demographic of users who are not exclusively crypto native. Arbitrum ecosystem has the opportunity to, via supporting the growth of Thales on Arbitrum, increase the adoption of the network itself. With advancements of account abstraction infrastructure and simplicity of Thales products, it is a perfect onboarding tool for supporting networks such as Arbitrum.


Additionally, with Thales having stronger growth metrics on competing L2 network due to a deployment head start and receiving competing network grants, this ARB grant has the potential to incentivize better growth of the Arbitrum deployment. It can move unique users over to Arbitrum over more lucrative conditions and showcase how an Arbitrum deployment can have better growth metrics compared to other L2 deployments of the same product.


Justification for the size of the grant:


Size of the grant is on par with our previous experiences of balancing responsible and fair expenditure of incentives while maintaining the uptrend of relevant growth metrics retained even when incentives are depleted. With the planned duration of the incentive programs, 500,000 ARB tokens are the perfect middle ground required to reach our goals and maintain long term adoption levels of Thales Arbitrum deployments.


Execution Strategy:


Execution strategies will use our developed offchain scripts and leaderboards to weekly snapshot fee rebates data, volume incentives distributions, competition results and direct campaign rewards. This collected data will be used in weekly direct airdrops of ARB and THALES rewards to eligible users.


Grant Timeline:


Grant is set to be distributed on a weekly basis starting from approximate time of receiving funds in November up until January 31st.


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?
 Yes


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS

Roadmap:


Thales Protocol next priority is implementing an Account Abstraction solutions that will allow frontends of Thales products to have a full Web2 experience while maintaining permissionlessness, non-custodial nature and decentralization. This will also allow onboarding users without prior crypto knowledge and developments of mobile apps driving on top of Thales smart contracts.


With the Thales smart contract architecture solidifying and maturing sufficiently, the next wave of growth and adoption comes from third party integrators. Thales is incentivizing, optimizing its architecture and streamlining documentation to fully support seamless integration of third party projects.

# SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size
: 250k ARB


Grant Matching: The Florence Finance Medici (FFM) token is currently not listed/liquid but when our token is live we will be using it to incentivize participation in our platform.


Grant Breakdown
:


Florence Finance aims to fuel the adoption of RWA on Arbitrum by being one of the first movers in RWAs to be native to the Arbitrum chain. RWAs have been gaining significant traction over the past few months and have the ability to onboard large amounts of liquidity to any given chain, as many key players are chasing real (world) yield.


In order to bootstrap our initial two RWA vaults on Arbitrum (current fixed RW yield of 7.25% for vault 1 and 9.5% for vault 2) we will use 100% of the 250k ARB grant as incentives to increase the overall APR of the Florence vaults. These incentives will be strictly used for new vault depositors rather than the existing vault participants, as we aim to onboard new liquidity to the Arbitrum RWA ecosystem.


Incentive distribution
:


We will distribute these ARB rewards over a 3-month period (ending January 31 2024) to new vault depositors therefore increasing the overall yield offering of Florence Finance with the aim of attracting new users to our platform and growing the broader RWA offering on Arbitrum.


Any new vault depositor will be able to stake their vault receipt token and begin earning the ARB rewards over the 3-month incentive period, this means that both vaults are equally incentivized with ARB rewards, so users will be able to earn the real-world yield on top of their incentivized ARB rewards.

Objectives
: [Clearly state the primary objectives of the grant and what you intend to achieve]


With this grant, Florence Finance aims to kickstart RWA adoption on the Arbitrum network by attracting more sticky liquidity to the ecosystem that is on the hunt for real-world yields onchain. We aim to attract new participants to our Florence Finance vaults and give them a taste of real-world sustainable yields with an extra perk of ARB incentives with the intention to ARB-pill them to this thriving DeFi ecosystem that we now call home.


We aim to increase the number of individual depositors in our vaults and increase the overall TVL of our platform with the help of these ARB incentives. We hope that new participants like the experience of earning real-world yield and are happy to stay in the vaults when the incentives end. We hope that this grant leads to the growth of our community as new users discover our platform through the increased yield making our platform more visible and attractive.

: We aim to increase the overall platform TVL, including protocol-owned liquidity.


Increase the number of vault token holders
: We will measure the level of participation in our protocol by monitoring the number of new holders of our vault tokens as this represents new users earning our real-world yield.


Community growth
: We aim to grow our community through this grant as the higher yields should make our platform more visible and help onboard new community members to our real-world asset vision. We can measure this through new Twitter followers and new members in our Telegram community.


Volume in our vault token liquidity pool
: as more people enter and exit our pools the volume of the liquidity pool should increase symbolizing growth in the number of participants.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
: [Provide details]


With the goal of offering a low-risk yet attractive yield through RWA, Florence acts as a safe haven for crypto users. As we focus on offering sustainable yields for the long term, we believe we have the ability to onboard very sticky liquidity. With the help of composability, our offering can form the building blocks for many different and exciting DeFi projects and products.


As RWA has a great appeal for institutional investors as well as retail participants we hope that by fostering growth in the Arbitrum RWA ecosystem we can help onboard institutional capital to the chain. As well as institutional investors we hope we can entice other RWA projects to follow our path and make Arbitrum their native chain.


We hope that making ourselves known as the go-to RWA platform on Arbitrum will mean that existing Arbitrum users who desire some RW yield in their portfolio no longer need to bridge to another chain to satisfy this desire, they can start earning RW yield natively in the Arbitrum ecosystem through Florence Finance. This should help with user and capital retention for the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.


Justification for the size of the grant:
 [Enter explanation]


As a native RWA platform on Arbitrum, we have already secured $5.4m in TVL through our institutional partners and have another $2m committed to fund new loans in the near future. We have built a novel platform that is unique and ambitious and has the ability to bring real growth to the crypto space and onboard more users while doing good in the real world by satisfying the shortage of SME funding in Europe.


Execution Strategy
: [Describe the plan for executing including resources, products, use of funds, and risk management. This includes allocations for specific pools, eligible assets, products, etc.]


We plan to distribute the ARB tokens as incentives for new Vault depositors, we will achieve this by creating a separate staking contract where new Vault depositors will be able to stake their Vault tokens (receipt tokens for depositing in the vault) and begin earning ARB emissions.


We have two vaults currently on our platform, “Caple Vault” with 7.25% APR and “Junior Vault” with 9.5% APR, both vaults will be eligible for the ARB rewards. Currently, the largest depositors in the vaults are our institutional lenders, these wallets will not receive any of the ARB incentives as we are only rewarding new depositors to the vaults. The eligible vault contracts are:


Caple Vault: 0xB982D9534A55a221d43be3bb120AA923bB7b917d


Junior Vault: 0x2f6B213a1331ba981cb740794B2AD58C31f8400f


The emissions of the ARB token rewards will be over a 3-month period and will be linearly emitted on a per-block basis. We will allocate the entire grant as emissions to this pool meaning that we will be emitting ~83,333 ARB tokens per month for 3 months totalling 250k ARB tokens. We believe this will create a big incentive for new depositors to enter the RWA vaults and be great marketing for the whole RWA ecosystem on Arbitrum as it draws attention to the sustainable yields we offer.


Grant Timeline:
 [Describe the timeline for the grant]


We will begin distributing the ARB incentives once the tokens are received and we will distribute the rewards over roughly 3 months ending on the 31st of January 2024.

# About **Florence Finance**

Florence Finance is a protocol that allows users to fund real-world loans with crypto assets. It works by letting users deposit stablecoins to the protocol in return for receipt tokens ($FLR or Loan Vault Tokens). Then the protocol will provide fiat currency (euros) to real-world lending platforms, who in turn lend the fiat currency to businesses. When loans are repaid, interest and principal flow back to the protocol to be distributed back to users. The protocol does not guarantee liquidity and is similar to peer-2-peer lending.

Users of Florence Finance can use the platform in two ways:

1. Use your stablecoins in a Loan Vault to earn yield from a real-world loan
2. Stake $FLR and earn Medici Token ($MDC)

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size:
 1,500,000 ARB


We will be applying for the Lighthouse Grant category. This is the recommended tier according to the following metrics:




Live on Arbitrum for at least 6 months → KyberSwap has been live on Arbitrum for 9+ months


Meets one of the following criteria:



$15M Arbitrum Network TVL: KyberSwap Arbitrum TVL is > $17M


$100M 30D cumulative Volume: KyberSwap Arbitrum 30D volume is > $120M








Grant Matching:
 150,000 KNC


Reasoning:
 KyberSwap initially received 1,158,932 ARB tokens in the first airdrop. To bootstrap liquidity, we have distributed approximately 1.2M KNC and 450K ARB for liquidity mining incentives to over 20 liquidity pools so far. Additionally, we’ve allocated more KNC to pools with other Arbitrum projects, such as Lido wstETH pools and Axelar axlUSDC, axlETH and axl.wstETH pools. This allocation follows a matching ratio of approximately 75% in KNC and 25% in ARB tokens. Taking into account how much more we allocated in our past and ongoing activities, we anticipate to be able to match a 1.5M ARB STIP grant allocation with up to 150,000 KNC.

There is a different contract address for each incentivized pool, which is subject to change based on optimization between farm phases; as updating a fee tier means a new pool, and more pools may be added. Please let us know if you need further clarification.




SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives:


The primary objective of liquidity incentives is to bootstrap 
optimized and sustainable liquidity
 for the most popular pairs and projects on Arbitrum. Simultaneously, we aim to attract a greater number of 
liquidity provider users
 to join the Arbitrum ecosystem. This optimized liquidity also plays an important role in enhancing 
trading volume
, given that trading volume scales with TVL. KyberSwap’s liquidity pools are meticulously designed to maximize such volume via capital efficiency, minimized slippage, and competitive rates. Moreover, KyberSwap’s DEX aggregator provides route customization options, enabling further enhancements to trading volume through not only KyberSwap liquidity, but also through all other major DEXs on Arbitrum. Finally, with these incentives, KyberSwap aims to 
partner with existing Arbitrum projects
 as well as 
onboard new projects to Arbitrum
.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):


TVL:
 At least ~2x increase in TVL from $17.7M to $35M in 3 months


Reasoning: Currently, the TVL on KyberSwap Arbitrum is at around $17.7M with around $200K in monthly incentives. The STIP grant would be around $1.23m (1.5M ARB @ ARB = 0.82), which will help to significantly boost liquidity bootstrapping activities. Spread over 3 months, that’s about ~$410K in monthly incentives. Based on this amount, we expect the TVL to grow about 2.3x to ~$41M. With a buffer to account for changing market conditions, we expect to reach at least $35M in TVL. The extra KNC matching would add another $108k (150K KNC @ KNC = 0.72) for the 4th month, or spread evenly on top of the ARB over 3 months.


Volume:
 At least ~1.5x increase in 7D volume from $28M to $42M in 3 months


Reasoning: Currently, KyberSwap Arbitrum gets about $28M in 7D volume. With the added incentives and creation of new pools, KyberSwap aims to increase this to at least $42M in 7D volume.


Liquidity partnerships:
 At least 5 liquidity partnerships with other projects over the 3 months from mid October 2023 to mid January 2024.


Reasoning: We aim to allocate a portion of the grant to liquidity mining incentives to establish and optimize liquidity for new and existing Arbitrum projects.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?


Aligned with the goals of the STIP program to incentivize the use of existing dApps on Arbitrum through increased volume, transactions, users, and liquidity, the STIP grant would enable us to build more optimized liquidity in terms of rates and slippage as well as diverse pairs and fee tiers. This would give more incentive for liquidity provider users to come to KyberSwap on Arbitrum, as well as more options for both new and existing liquidity providers. KyberSwap also has a strong record for optimizing liquidity for partner projects, such as Lido wstETH pools and Axelar axlUSDC, axlETH and axl.wstETH pools. Part of this grant will be allocated to even more partner pools. This will not only enable us to further support existing Arbitrum projects to optimize their liquidity, but also to onboard new partners to the Arbitrum ecosystem via KyberSwap.


Justification for the size of the grant:


KyberSwap has been supporting innovation and growth in the blockchain space since the beginning; and has built a liquidity and trading product portfolio dedicated to the best user experience, igniting a supportive community of DeFi projects and users, many of which are on Arbitrum. Since our expansion to Arbitrum, KyberSwap has become an important player in the ecosystem, highlighting our commitment to the growth of the ecosystem and to enhancing trading and liquidity experiences for the Arbitrum community. For example, 
KyberSwap has integrated about 20 major Arbitrum DEXs into our DEX aggregator
, including GMX, Camelot and Uniswap.


So far, our KyberSwap Elastic AMM has facilitated over $3.07B in volume with over 7,488 unique addresses that provided liquidity and 334,809 unique addresses that traded. To date, we’ve spent 1,197,800 KNC (~$862,416 @ KNC = 0.72) to bootstrap initial liquidity on Arbitrum via liquidity mining, achieving positive results. This would be scaled up with the help of the STIP grant.


Furthermore, we are continuing to establish new partnerships and growth streams for the Arbitrum ecosystem. Not only do our liquidity pools support intra-chain volume, but also inter-chain volume. For example, we’ve incentivized liquidity 
to support Ethereum to Arbitrum ETH and wstETH bridging/cross-chain swaps together with Axelar, Squid and Lido
. KyberSwap’s custom fee tiers and minimized slippage played a key role in this enablement. The STIP grant would further enable us to establish even more strong partnerships that can contribute to the ecosystem.


Execution Strategy:


We plan to allocate and distribute the incentives similar to the following example distribution.


Note: Incentivized pool pairs, fee tiers and allocations subject to change based on optimization between phases. However, the total amount of ARB per month will remain the same at 500K per month over the 3 month period.

Approach to sustainable liquidity growth


KyberSwap focuses on sustainable liquidity, and as such, optimizes liquidity pools constantly in a way that can maximize both volume and LP fees so that, over time, LP fees can make up an increasing part of total APR. For example, one of the ways to measure the sustainability of a protocol is such LP fees since LP fees are organic APR, vs farm APR from incentives. Currently, KyberSwap generates some of the most LP fees per TVL for liquidity providers. In the past 24h, KyberSwap on Arbitrum has generated $10.32K in fees for LPs with $17.8M in liquidity. Comparatively, Camelot has generated about $10.5K in fees for LPs with $56M in liquidity. And in KyberSwap’s case, a significant portion (over 50%) of the LP fees generated were on ARB-paired pools, incentivizing more LPs to hold and supply ARB.

2674×1498 429 KB


Additionally, another aspect of KyberSwap’s focus on sustainable liquidity via organic volume and LP fees is through custom fee tiers. KyberSwap has particularly high fee tier options such as 2% and 5% for some liquidity pools. While lower fee tier pools support general trading volume, these kinds of fee tiers serve another type of volume which is scalable with price volatility. These high fee tier pools further provide organic APR for liquidity providers while not affecting traders. Together, the lower fee and higher fee tier pools work together to support all types of volume demand, balancing out the interests of liquidity providers for APR and the interests of traders for lower rates.


Grant Timeline:


We plan to allocate and distribute the ARB from the STIP grant over a period of 3 months (estimated from mid October 2023 to mid January 2024, as per the program requirements). The start and end date are dependent on when the grant is finally received. The KNC matching can be allocated in the 4th month for smooth transition, or spread evenly across the same 3 months.


Funding Tranches:


500K ARB per month over a period of 3 months (estimated from mid-October 2023 to mid-January 2024, as per the program requirements).

SECTION 6: Data and Reporting


Is your team prepared to create Dune Dashboards according to program requirements for your incentive program?


Yes, we intend to. The STIP application requirements include the creation of a dashboard showing daily TVL, transactions, volume, addresses, and network fees covering 30 days before/during/after incentivization. We already have this data in our own program and will convert it: 
KyberSwap Elastic Analytics


If not, how does your team plan to report grant data?


Note that in unforeseen circumstances, we may have to use another data medium as we currently don’t use Dune Dashboard though we intend to.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size
: 1,000,000 ARB


Grant Matching
:


Socket doesn’t have a token and hence can’t match with token co-incentives. However, we plan to allocate significant marketing efforts & resources to our partners to attract users & liquidity. To achieve these we will be conducting marketing campaigns, tutorials, guides & more!


We also plan to allocate significant developer efforts & resources to help our partners build great onboarding experiences along with 24/7 user & developer support.


Lastly, we will continue to educate users & community about bridging through initiatives like our 
Bridge Risk Framework 1
, which we launched in collaboration with L2Beat.


Grant Breakdown


We think of Arbitrum as an ecosystem of chains including Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova & upcoming Arbitrum Orbit chains. With an increasing number of L2s and L3s, the problem of liquidity fragmentation & bridging only increases in size.


The purpose of this grant is to fight the increasing fragmentation & unlock seamless flow of liquidity into the Arbitrum ecosystem. We will use the allocated tokens to achieve this by:




Working with 80+ partner ecosystems to subsidize onboarding costs for users onboarding onto Arbitrum One ecosystem


Encouraging developers to build unique cross-chain use cases that bring TVL into Arbitrum ecosystem. More on these use cases below


Incentivizing the adoption of Socket’s SuperBridge allowing users to easily transfer liquidity from other L2’s into Orbit app chains

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives


The primary objective of the grant is to work with Arbitrum ecosystem & attract liquidity/TVL into Arbitrum One, Arbitrum L3s and more.


We intend to bring a seamless bridging of liquidity through Socket ecosystem that has access to over 50M wallets via top web3 wallets like Metamask, Coinbase Wallet and apps including GMX, Zapper, Zerion, Layer3, Jones DAO, Lyra & more!


Here are key use cases that the grant will help us push with current & future partners:




Offering subsidized bridging for users bridging to Arbitrum. This includes projects like Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow Wallet, Bungee Exchange, XDEFI, Slingshot, Layer3, Zapper, Zerion & more


Create chain agnostic onboarding experience into Arbitrum which allows users on Polygon/Optimism etc. to directly onboard into Arbitrum apps in 1 click (no bridging, swapping, switching RPCs or even needing GAS on Arbitrum)


Work with Arbitrum Orbit chains to allow users to bridge funds into the chains at NO COST. Our unique approach allows this with  
0 bridge fees, 0 slippage, and no liquidity pools
.
 This is already live with Aevo & going live with Arbitrum Orbit chains soon.


Expand tokens native to other chains to Arbitrum while retaining complete ownership of the token. This is based on Sovereign Token Standard- allowing token issuers to securely expand to Arbitrum with no bridge lock-in.




All of the above use cases not only help bring native TVL into the Arbitrum ecosystem but also help increase significant transaction activity for Arbitrum ecosystem apps.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):


We will use the following KPI’s to track the success of our grant:




Cross-chain TVL migrated to Arbitrum


Total volume & users bridged into Arbitrum


Number of first-time users bridging to Arbitrum




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?


There are 4 major ways we foster growth and innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem:




Better UX in Arbitrum Native Applications: The typical user journey of a user on Polygon who wants to deploy on Arbitrum app is 40+ clicks and 10+ tabs. We work with apps to reduce it to a single transaction & click. The grant will encourage the usage on these apps & encourage more apps to adopt such innovative UX drive features


Native bridging to Arbitrum in wallets: A year back no wallet allowed users to bridge to Arbitrum natively in the wallet. Socket has expanded this coverage by working with top wallets. The grant will encourage the usage & discovery of bridging features on these wallets and encourage more wallets to add native bridging into Arbitrum


Bootstrap Arbitrum Orbit chains: Users directly want to jump into L3s directly from other L2s without multiple hoops like L2 → Arbitrum → L3. Liquidity bridges do not scale for such use cases because of issues like extensive liquidity bootstrapping. We offer a unique solution that allows users to bridge into L3s from any chain without any liquidity pools or bridge fee


Expansion of non-Arbitrum native apps to Arbitrum: Today a protocol with token on BSC has no way to expand to Arbitrum without locking the token into the specific bridge. We allow these projects to come securely using sovereign standards and be bridge agnostic always




Justification for the size of the grant:


The objective of the token distribution is to supercharge our existing efforts of liquidity migration and user onboarding into Arbitrum.


The grant becomes immediately accessible to 50MN+ wallets via our 80+ partner ecosystem & many more incoming partners. This includes top wallets like Metamask, Rainbow Slingshot, XDEFI, OneKey & Zerion, and top protocols including GMX, JonesDAO, Mux Protocol, Lyra, Level & Bungee


The grant also helps bootstrap Arbitrum Orbit chains with unique onboarding experience and bring new Arbitrum native apps to massively attract cross-chain TVL. Finally, we’re also helping expand non-Arbitrum protocols expand to Arbitrum.


For reference, here’s a quick look into out existing stats showcasing our existing impact on Arbitrum ecosystem:




Collectively bridged $1.5Bn+ volume into Arbitrum across 1.5M+ transactions


Been one of the first bridging partners to Arbitrum since Dec’21


Were the 2nd most used bridge during Odyssey Bridge Week


Socket is a Top 10 protocol on Arbitrum according to Nansen


Used by over 30+ wallets, apps & protocols on Arbitrum

1094×884 60.9 KB




Execution Strategy:


$ARB tokens will be distributed to developers building on Socket, users bridging to Arbitrum One and other Arbitrum chains using Socket.


Users (100%) - 1.0M ARB


Here is the breakdown of how the tokens will be distributed amongst different user groups:


Note: We plan to have a max cap per transaction & a minimum bridging amount to avoid sybiling.


700,000 ARB: Users bridging to Arbitrum One through Socket API/SDK contracts:


Every user that onboards to Arbitrum via Socket via our partner apps(bridging/cross-chain deposits) will have 80% of their total onboarding fees refunded in $ARB. The total onboarding fee includes the total GAS spent + the bridging fee from the underlying bridges


200,000 ARB: Users bridging to Arbitrum Orbit Chains via Socket SuperBridge (0 cost L2-L3 bridging)


Every user that onboards to Orbit Chains via Socket SuperBridge, will have 80% of their total onboarding fees refunded in $ARB. The total onboarding fee includes the total GAS spent + the bridging fee from the underlying bridges.


100,000 ARB: Users bridging SuperTokens (Sovereign token standard) into Arbitrum One/Orbit chains


Every user that bridges Supertoken between Arbitrum and Orbit chains will receive bridge rebates. This will help strengthen the adoption of LSTs/stablecoins/governance tokens on Arbitrum.


Grant Timeline:


Since the contracts and analytics infrastructure for this are already set up we could target a launch in a few weeks of grant approval. We expect rewards to last 2-3 months but it will ultimately depend on the bridging volume.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives


Radiant Capital proposes a strategic grant from the Arbitrum DAO aimed at ecosystem growth, grounded in the success of our recent ARB airdrop. This initiative drove significant metrics, like a 
19%
 increase in TVL and 
80 ETH
 in sequencer revenue generated. We’re requesting a grant between 37,952 and 2,852,044 ARB through January 31st based on achieving the 
proposed milestones
 to extend our impact in three core areas:






Sticky Liquidity:
 Leveraging our proprietary long-term Dynamic Liquidity Provisioning (dLP), we aim to incentivize new and existing lenders through an ARB airdrop. This airdrop design secures long-term liquidity by targeting Arbitrum and cross-chain “whitespace” users who have yet to engage with Arbitrum.






Ecosystem Enrichment
: Our collaborative initiatives with existing protocols—GMX, Camelot, Dopex, and Plutus, aim to diversify liquidity pools, enhance lending options, and foster a robust options market.






Future Integration:
 As Radiant readies its Ethereum Mainnet launch and leverages our presence on the BNB Chain, this grant can attract a broader user base to Arbitrum.






The proposed milestones will insulate the Arbitrum DAO from needing to over-allocate ARB in the event of underperformance. Transparency reports will be issued based on Arbitrum’s incentive framework guidelines, outlining key performance indicators to measure the grant’s effectiveness. Our track record in driving long-term liquidity and user adoption makes us confident this grant will provide substantial and lasting value to the Arbitrum ecosystem.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)


Radiant will track KPIs such as Incremental TVL, whitespace users, total user growth, and sequencer revenue generated through the initiatives conducted in this proposal, should it be approved. See Section 5 for additional details.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?


The Radiant protocol’s v2 foundation and utility have proven to be of interest to the Arbitrum ecosystem and beyond. This can be attributed to:






Omnichain Money Market
: As DeFi’s first cross-chain lending protocol built atop Layer Zero Labs and Stargate, Radiant allows users to deposit and borrow assets across chains seamlessly. Radiant aims to exist on every EVM chain, unifying tens of billions of fragmented liquidity and eliminating the need for countless transactions to lend, borrow, bridge, and swap between chains.






DeFi 3.0:
 Early iterations of DeFi featured many copycat protocols with little utility and high-emission governance tokens. With the Radiant DAO’s v2 launch, Radiant continues to allow all users to borrow and lend cross-chain. However, emissions are gated to only users who provide utility to the protocol through 
Dynamic Liquidity Provisioning
.






New collateral support:
 As the Radiant DAO expands its cross-chain functionality to additional chains, new collateral options will emerge with DAO-voted Loan-To-Value parameters and oracle usage. Radiant is the first significant money market on Arbitrum to support ARB as collateral. It has the second largest TVL of ARB token on the chain behind Uniswap, adding incremental utility to the token by unlocking its borrowing power.






Justification for the size of the grant


Radiant has grown significantly since its fair launch in July 2022, partly thanks to its revenue-sharing model and 
community-focused ethos
. As the 2nd highest TVL protocol on Arbitrum (including pool2), Radiant holds an 11% share of on-chain TVL, while the grant request is UP TO 5.7% of the $50M short-term budget with milestone guardrails in place.


The grant proposal and its size deserve consideration for three reasons:






Demonstrated Success: Radiant effectively utilized its initial ARB allocation to deliver positive growth metrics, validating its capability to execute liquidity grants.






Market Expansion: With a presence on BNB Chain and an impending Mainnet launch, Radiant is uniquely positioned to tap into high-TVL, high-activity user bases across chains. If approved, this grant can drive awareness, interest, and demand into the Arbitrum ecosystem through Radiant’s presence on other chains.






Sticky Liquidity: Radiant’s dLP system encourages long-term engagement, evident from the 6-12 month lock periods and the 
substantial retention of ARB
 tokens airdropped to users through Radiant’s campaign (⅔ of users that claimed the airdrop held the token).






Impact Metrics on Arbitrum


Following the approval of 
RFP-18
, which focused on strategically allocating the initial ARB airdrop from the Arbitrum Foundation to the Radiant DAO, we’ve seen remarkable growth in key metrics. Radiant is now well-positioned to amplify this success.


Screenshot 2023-09-28 at 2.28.59 AM
922×183 17.9 KB

Radiant is consistently the go-to money market of choice on Arbitrum, evidenced by Nansen’s stats on 7 day users and transactions, generating significant sequencer revenue for the Arbitrum DAO.


1115×440 71.9 KB


Announced
 on May 17 and 
wrapping up
 on July 17, the campaign not only moved the needle but also shattered expectations. Specifically, the number of RDNT token holders soared from 77,902 to 130,206—
a remarkable 67% growth
.


1112×433 69.1 KB

Our cumulative user base leaped from 181,379 to 
275,466
, marking a substantial 
52% increase in Radiant users.


1022×539 71.6 KB

The campaign also significantly contributed to 
Arbitrum’s total value locked (TVL)
, boosting it from $163.9M to nearly 
$195M
—a substantial increase of almost 
19%
. Compared to other top Arbitrum protocols—GMX and Stargate declining by -12.29% and -17.98%, respectively, and Uniswap dropping by -2.89%—Radiant’s nearly 19% boost in TVL stands out as a notable contributor to Arbitrum’s ecosystem health.


1063×450 62.2 KB

Radiant’s 
locked dLP on Arbitrum grew by 34.5%, reaching $49.58M
 by the end of the initial ARB campaign. This supported Radiant’s growth and fortified Arbitrum’s broader liquidity infrastructure. Radiant’s incentive mechanisms are well-aligned with Arbitrum’s overarching goals.


1600×355 122 KB

During the campaign, Radiant’s protocol generated over 
80 ETH in sequencer revenue
, resulting in a 
10% ROI in this category alone
. This underscores the economic viability of the initiative. Additionally, the campaign effectively redistributed and decentralized the governance of Arbitrum to users with long-term mindsets.


Long-Term Ecosystem Value


The Radiant protocol has already injected significant value into the Arbitrum ecosystem and will continue this trajectory, magnified by approving the grant. Since its launch on July 24, 2022, 202 million RDNT tokens have been awarded as incentives for lending, borrowing, and liquidity provision—equating to $46.5M at the current token price of $0.23.


Our existing emissions runway projects a distribution of an additional 100 million RDNT by July 2027. This equates to a future value of $23M.


Crucially, Radiant’s v2 tokenomics are engineered to encourage committed participation. We’ve 
effectively filtered out mercenary liquidity 
by requiring dynamic liquidity providers (dLPs) to maintain a
 5% dLP ratio to their total deposits for emissions eligibility
. These 
dLPs are also allocated 60% of all protocol fees 
and influence the DAO’s governance. This way, Radiant’s incentive structure
 rewards and retains key ecosystem participants
.


1120×809 177 KB

With $53M of dLP locked on Arbitrum, the protocol averages 
$1.2M in monthly fees,
 according to DeFi Llama. Of these fees, 60% go directly to eligible dLP lockers. Should Radiant sustain and expand this rate, we’re looking at a projected 
$62M in fees funneled to ecosystem participants
 by 2027.


Execution Strategy


1. New Lenders & Dynamic Liquidity Provider Airdrop  (0 to 2,060,440 ARB)






The amount of ARB granted requires achieving the proposed milestones outlined in the 
Transparency report
 by the end of the campaign:


1600×289 260 KB






Incremental TVL & new dLP milestones must be attained for grant distribution. If no milestone is reached, this initiative has no payout.






The incremental TVL determines the total ARB allocation at the end of the campaign, times the airdrop multiplier, divided by the ARB price.






Example campaign results: $13,500,000 (incremental TVL Milestone 3) * .05714 (Multiplier) = 771,390 USD / ARB Price (.91) = 847,681






Incremental TVL
 & 
New dLP
 count from the campaign’s start to end. 
Incremental TVL is defined as new dLP + unlooped lending TVL
.






TVL
: Airdrop multiplier increases with the milestones as goalposts to encourage attainment.






The campaign starts within 30 days post-approval and runs for a randomized duration ending no later than January 31, 2024, to curb gamification.






Users lock or relock NEW dLP on Arbitrum for 6-12 months to qualify.






The amount of ARB assigned to each user depends on their total NEW dLP locked against the total NEW Arbitrum dLP value by the end of the campaign.






Radiant will work with an on-chain reputation protocol such as 
Nomis
  and/or 
Trustalabs
 to identify whitespace users and assign a multiplier score from 0-100…






Whitespace is defined as a user that has transacted reasonably over a duration of time on other EVM chains but has little to no transaction history on Arbitrum.






For example, user A is eligible for 26 Arb airdrop with a whitespace score 50. The total Arb user A receives is 39 ARB=  26(1+0.5).






Post-campaign, qualified users can claim ARB via Radiant’s claim page.


80%
584×659 111 KB






2. GMX v2 BTC & ETH GM Lender’s Airdrop (0 to 483,516 ARB)


1042×351 61.5 KB






Should this proposal be approved, GMX is positioned as the prime recipient for the highest ecosystem allocation, with distinct advantages in attracting new liquidity and user engagement.






The selection of BTC and ETH as GM collateral types is underpinned by the relative market size and their potential to maximize revenue streams for Radiant protocol and Arbitrum sequencers.






GMX will push its incentives into v2 (trader rebates and liquidity incentives). They will be voting to create a quick migration path from GLP into GM tokens, and Radiant should be well-positioned to add utility to GM tokens by unlocking their borrowing power.






Airdrops are favored as a more dynamic method to boost demand, as evidenced by Radiant’s prior ARB airdrop campaign and general airdrop activity on EVM chains.






The amount of ARB granted requires achieving the proposed milestones outlined in the 
Transparency report
 by the end of the campaign:


1600×250 198 KB






To qualify for the airdrop, GM Radiant lenders must 
maintain a 5% ratio of dLP to total deposits
 at the block number the campaign period ends (will be announced on socials).






If approved, a second proposal requires ratification within Radiant DAO governance to add GM collateral support, followed by a 30-to-90-day implementation period involving dev work, risk assessments, audits, and testing.  If the proposal does not pass, the allocation of ARB for this initiative is no longer required.






Example campaign results: $2,300,000  (GMX V2 TVL Milestone 2) * .02 (Multiplier) = 46,000 USD / ARB Price (.91) = 50,549






3. Camelot v3 + Dopex v2 RDNT/ETH Liquidity Incentives (28,062 to 242,154 ARB)






Camelot recently launched a v3 concentrated liquidity pool for RDNT/ETH with xgrail market maker incentives.






Dopex v2 is estimated to launch in October/November. Users can deposit their concentrated liquidity AMM (CLAMM) positions in the upgrade, such as Camelot v3 LPs. The CLAMM will allow users to exercise at any time, a departure from the European options that Dopex has used. This is a unified layer of liquidity layer for Dopex products.






Dopex v2 allows for higher efficiency with concentrated liquidity positions and enables the ecosystem to hedge RDNT positions on-chain, providing ways to mitigate downside exposure.






The initiative fits well with previous grant proposals by adding utility and flexibility to Radiant while increasing the potential for Camelot & Dopex to gain incremental volume and users.


image
922×150 6.92 KB






Camelot’s proposal includes 20,000 ARB bi-weekly allocated to the RDNT/ETH pool. Should their proposal pass, this will be factored into the table, and unused ARB will either be reallocated to Dopex v2 within the milestone parameters or returned to the Arbitrum DAO at the end of the campaign.








PlutusDAO: plsRDNT Incentives (9,890 to 65,934 ARB)


1107×271 40.9 KB








Plutus DAO, known as Arbitrum’s governance “black hole,” controls over $1.7M in plsRDNT, a product that locks dLP for 12 months and funnels Radiant’s protocol revenue back to stakers.






The impending introduction of plvRDNT will expand utility by using 
dLP eligibility
 to enable lending and borrowing features for its users in Radiant’s money markets.






Plutus seeks to offer users an exit route via the Chronos DEX liquidity pool. The current need is to align user demand better, as staking plsRDNT offers greater utility than mere liquidity provision.






The launch of plvRDNT should augment the GMX proposal by enabling Plutus to unlock over $34M in lending potential within Radiant’s money market.






An evaluation period will determine the most suitable DEX for this liquidity pair, whether Chronos or another platform, followed by a four-month co-incentivization phase with Plutus based on the proposed milestones and distribution schedule.




1600×275 206 KB






Grant Timeline






If the Arbitrum DAO prefers to send a linear bi-weekly stream, then the maximum allocation of 2,842,046 can be sent linearly via bi-weekly streams through January 31, 2024. After campaign completion, unused ARB based on milestone attainment will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO.






Radiant recommends executing 2 bi-weekly payouts at Milestone 1 for Camelot/Dopex and Plutus initiatives before enforcing the milestone criteria to allow sufficient time to build awareness, interest, and demand. If Milestone 1 is not reached by the 3rd bi-weekly stream, then incentives may cease and be reassessed at the next bi-weekly stream until Milestone 1 is achieved.






Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?


Yes, however, any unilateral cancellation or modification of the campaign’s terms related to the airdrops post-announcement would constitute a breach of good faith and could undermine community trust. Based on the proposed airdrop framework, users will choose to lock liquidity for six months to one year and therefore this should only be done in very extreme circumstances.


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?


Radiant launched on Arbitrum on July 24, 2022, as the first chain deployment. We consider Arbitrum our home - most of Radiant’s TVL, community, and marketing efforts are conducted on Arbitrum.


Arbitrum’s transaction fee mitigation, combined with Ethereum’s security and institutional adoption, enables Radiant to build an ecosystem that provides users competitive interest-bearing opportunities while maintaining high safety.


Radiant built its money market on top of Layer Zero Labs and the Stargate stable router interface to facilitate seamless cross-chain lending and borrowing. Radiant’s omnichain ambitions should not be a deterrent and should be seen as a net benefit to the ecosystem. Radiant can tap into other user bases through its presence on other chains. Even when users borrow cross-chain from Arbitrum, their deposited collateral remains on Arbitrum.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?


Radiant v2 was deployed on BNB chain in April 2023, with a pending deployment on Ethereum Mainnet in October 2023.


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?


7/24/22.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size: 200K ARB (Beacon Grant)


Grant Matching: NA


Grant Breakdown: The grant targets to distribute 200,000 ARB over a three month period to the Good Entry EzVaults with a rewards target at ~8% with an assumption of $10,000,000 TVL. Good Entry Ezvaults is one of its flagship product that allows liquidity providers


Funding Address: arb1:0xB36FAa35034dd0E6307258cfe38793D3A5254dD3


Funding Address Characteristics: Multisig, This will be 2/3 multisig with private keys securely stored.


Contract Address: To be determined


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives:


Our Project’s goal to contribute to the ecosystem is to make Arbitrum the main Degen Hub. Even in an ongoing bear, there are many day traders still active. We aim to serve their needs. We do so by building more TVL with a target of 10m because this benchmark enables Good Entry Labs to achieve the following:






Interest: Generate sufficient interest and encourage more first time users to try Good Entry. Since our inception we have seen that TVL has remained sticky on our platform and traders have repaid our LPs with significant fees exceeding ~20% APY on stables or native assets. We would also like to increase the number of assets tradeable on our platform.






Rankings: At 10m TVL, Good Entry based on Defillama rankings would be a top 15 derivatives protocol across all chains and within top 10 on Arbitrum. Currently Good Entry is ranked 43 across all chains and rank 14 on Arbitrum. The rankings are an indicator for community members to meaningfully track its growth within the context of the current landscape and make judgments on its growth trajectory. Positive action will likely inspire or continue the flywheel effect.






Revenue: Generate revenue to demonstrate we are a real decentralized business that can thrive on chain. Earnings to be distributed to locked token holders.






Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):




Revenue: Track TVL growth and Revenue earnings


Rankings: Follow rankings on DeFillama across all chains and Arbitrum


Interest: Track changes on total users, ezVault suppliers + Adding more Trading Pairs




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


We are the first notable V3 derivatives project deployed  on chain across the narrative and have found product market fit. By receiving a grant, we are able to increase visibility and encourage new users to come into the platform in the short term.


One notable feature of Good Entry is our ability to create derivatives markets for Alts beyond the majors (BTC & ETH). This is an important solution because a major problem in both traditional (Deribit) and private markets (Market makers) is that it has been difficult to create option markets for tokens with good pricing. By incentivising the growth of new markets such as ARB and GMX on Good Entry, we demonstrate to the ecosystem that we can do so for other tokens. The benefits for these projects is that it increases leverage for traders to enter markets thereby creating more volume. The beginning of a flywheel for token scalability is volume. When there is no volume, even if a token has a high market cap, it cannot realize its value because traders cannot buy and sell at size, thereby stagnating the project.


When these projects see that it is easy to start their own derivatives markets very quickly with us. They will notice the rise in degen activity for them. That assumption is that more trading volume arises, more interest is sustained, a good momentum can be built for projects.


Justification for the size of the grant:


The grant is not intended to be the main source of yield for ezVault liquidity providers. It is meant as a bonus to incentivise first time users to participate in the platform. Data on our Dune shows that once users try Good Entry, they tend to stick.


We are Arbitrum first and exclusive. Our product is also the first of its kind and not a clone of a tradfi product. By supporting Good Entry, it is supporting the growth of a possible second GMX and DeFi focused innovation.


Further, Good Entry is also not supported by any VCs. It is community first. This means anyone participating with Good Entry does so on the same terms. The project would benefit significantly from this grant to increase its market share and scalability. As Arbitrum first, we are Arb Maxis, any notable success we gain will be associated with the ecosystem’s reputation.


The TVL target shared is reasonable and the APY is competitive at an 8% boost. The grant amount is the smallest and yet creates a significant impact in climbing the rankings.


Moreover Good Entry succeeds on Arbitrum, it would incentivise more teams to come to Arbitrum to list their tokens so that they benefit from the Ezvaults and facilitate their own token trading.


Execution Strategy:


Good Entry will calculate ARB tokens to be disbursed off chain and distribute the airdrop on a month by month basis to ensure that only TVL that has been sticky is eligible.


Grant Timeline:




Announcement of successful grant


Announcement of rewards programme and building awareness for 2 weeks.


Incentive period: 12 weeks


Prepare grant results: 4 weeks, for 30 days data post grant.




Good Entry is ready to go on an engineering front as we have an ongoing retro-mining scheme where token rewards are calculated off chain. This is reflected accurately on the front end.


Tokens can be distributed from ARB foundation on a monthly basis to users directly based on the team’s submission.


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream? YES


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Provide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?: YES


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?: NO


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?: Good Entry was deployed on Arbitrum in March 2023.


Protocol Performance:




Total users: 1357


Ezvault suppliers: 795


Peak daily users: 186


Peak Protocol transactions: 373


Peak Protected Perpetuals Position: ~$300,000


Total positions: 2024 as at 21 September 2023


Peak TVL: ~1.72m

What we observe in our core stats is that the number of users continue to grow as they have made significant gains over their trading journey with us. Why they are interested is because our protected perpetuals product allows our users to trade with leverage safely. When they get it wrong, they are protected from the downside. They merely pay the funding rate, which can be ~0.009%/ hour. Nothing that can significantly affect their overall portfolio position. This works superbly for trading specific events such as the CPI print.


Screenshot 2023-10-04 at 7.32.23 PM
1848×1056 122 KB

Good Entry has been 100% supportive of our community. As we started our pre-mining programme, we see that liquidity providers have remained sticky as organic yield is near 20% APY. We are confident that TVL remains sticky with Good Entry  because even after we had a minor bug exploit in September, TVL remains in the project. There was not a flight to safety with massive withdrawals. We have since launched our production dApp and mitigated all known bugs as assessed with Code4rena.


Protocol Roadmap:


Good Entry is working on creating a more predictable pricing mechanism for the protected perpetuals to ensure traders can better estimate pricing. In earlier iterations, swap fees were included and that can cause traders to take on losses when price chops at the entry price. This is most significant for institutional traders where the largest volumes are likely to come from.

SECTION 1: APPLICANT INFORMATION


Applicant Name:

Ironboots, 0xMyrddin


Project Name:


Camelot


Project Description:


As Arbitrum’s largest native DEX, Camelot provides custom liquidity infrastructure tooling and fosters a collaborative environment for innovation that incentivizes teams to build specifically on Arbitrum.


Camelot offers one of the broadest range of liquidity pools on Arbitrum and is a natural hub for both users and builders. With over 48 partner pools, Camelot has introduced numerous protocols to the ecosystem and has close relationships with the largest builders such as GMX, Pendle, Radiant, Dopex, Plutus and more. Camelot moves beyond the traditional role of a DEX to also provide extensive support and advisory for liquidity structuring, emissions management and more.


Camelot provides a full suite of liquidity products from a custom-built incentive layer to integrated concentrated liquidity strategies, allowing Arbitrum builders to achieve a bespoke balance of efficiency and practicality. Camelot can cater towards liquidity that requires maximum efficiency, whilst also providing support for illiquid long-tail assets. In turn, this leads to the most sustainable and economical liquidity across both protocol tokens and core assets, as displayed by the diverse fee generation and TVL graphs detailed below.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size:


3.09m ARB*

(*minimum of 1.87m spent, up to 3.09m based on methodology and KPIs detailed below)


Grant Matching
:


Camelot’s existing liquidity incentives to be maintained or increased, including various external rewards provided by partners


Grant Breakdown:


Camelot will allocate up to 3.09m ARB tokens as liquidity incentives over 3 months in the following categories, with the majority of the incentives focusing on partner pools and the broader adoption of $ARB as a base liquidity asset. Camelot will receive 512k per epoch and intends to begin the initial distribution with 400k ARB. Depending on the performance the following epochs can be increased or decreased by a maximum of 10%, thereby creating a min and max range of 1.87m to 3.09m ARB in total. This is shown below in the relevant table. Any ARB that has not been used will be returned at the end of the programme.


The distribution will leverage a variety of methods, including highly efficient concentrated liquidity strategies, Nitro pools, and other custom-built features as part of Camelot’s battle-tested infrastructure. Further justification and details for all incentive allocations are included throughout the rest of this application.

Camelot supports over 40 partners, and a breakdown of each pool and its initial distribution is included in the spreadsheet below. Camelot is committed to a sustainable & methodical approach and will therefore be adjusting emissions each epoch basis the relevant KPIs and metrics, which includes fees generated, volume, TVL, incentives per pool, and more. Most importantly, Camelot’s ability to distribute to a broad variety of pools is only possible through its continued expansion and scaling over the past year, and is not something that can be easily replicated with simple formulas.


CAMELOT ARB ALLOCATION BREAKDOWN


As part of Camelot’s commitment to sustainability, the total incentives distributed for each epoch will be based on the performance of the KPIs, with a maximum adjustment of +/- 10%. This ensures that incentives are not being used without a clear justification for their effectiveness, and is reflected in the above table. In addition, the reserve portion will be specifically used to onboard new protocols or partners that are not included in the initial scope.

No contract address can’t be shared before the distribution is actually set up, but Camelot will permanently keep a list all of them up to date during the entire duration of the campaign.


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives:


Camelot was conceived to help deliver Arbitrum’s goal of scaling and revolutionizing the future of Ethereum. Through its commitment to supporting native builders, Camelot strives to build the foundation of sustainable liquidity and collaboration that will allow Arbitrum and its diverse ecosystem to thrive.


Camelot has a proven track record of bringing in new builders to the ecosystem (Pendle, Vela, Thales, DMT, Aurory, Lyra, and many more) whilst also forming deep relationships with core native protocols such as GMX, Jones, Radiant, Plutus, Dopex, and more. Camelot is uniquely positioned to work closely with these partners to support the broader adoption of ARB as a base asset. The majority of new Arbitrum projects list their initial liquidity on Camelot, which provides the best opportunity to work with partners to seed their pools with ARB from launch.


Most importantly, Camelot has developed a comprehensive suite of liquidity products to offer protocols a wide range of tailored options. Whilst volume and TVL numbers can often vary depending on the liquidity profile of a token and market conditions, fees generated can be used as a more consistent reference for the performance of a pool. In this case, Camelot’s flexibility allows for significantly higher fee generation. Consistent fees generated is the primary source of real yield for users, and therefore provides a long-term solution that isn’t entirely reliant on incentives. Concentrated liquidity pools can be incentivized efficiently through Merkl or automated managers, while less liquid and more volatile partner tokens can achieve efficient fee generation through standard XYK pools and our Nitro pool infrastructure. We believe that there is no ‘one size fits all’ approach, and the Camelot protocol has been built to reflect that.


The objectives are clear:






Onboard new protocols to the Arbitrum ecosystem by offering bespoke liquidity support and incentives for new protocols




As part of the support for new token listings, Camelot is uniquely positioned to encourage the use of $ARB in protocol-owned-liquidity, making it the most attractive option for new protocols








Increase adoption of the $ARB token by incentivising protocols to adopt $ARB as a paired asset whilst also incentivising highly efficient $ARB base liquidity






Deepen spot liquidity for Arbitrum’s key protocols by incentivising ecosystem partner pools, offering bespoke support catered to each projects requirements






Leverage a data driven, dynamic approach to increase the sustainability of incentives and achieve long-term sticky liquidity across a broad range of pools






Increase overall protocol liquidity depth on Arbitrum by incentivizing and supporting protocols to leverage Camelot’s concentrated-liquidity solutions






Camelot will leverage its natively integrated automated liquidity managers to incentivize concentrated liquidity efficiently and in a user-friendly manner. Concentrated liquidity traditionally requires active and manual management, so this solution allows us to provide a passive option that caters to a wider range of user needs.




Camelot will use its Merkl integration to distribute incentives directly to concentrated liquidity providers. Through Merkle, the most efficient LPs are rewarded based on their generated fees, making it one of the most effective methods of incentive distribution.


Camelot’s custom-built incentive layer (spNFTs and Nitro pools) allows for highly focused and permissionless incentivisation, allowing partners to provide additional rewards








Stimulate broader collaboration and broader development growth in the ecosystem






Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):




TVL growth


Fees growth


Volume growth


Adoption of ARB as a base asset


New partners and protocols supported on Arbitrum (both multichain and native protocols)




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


Camelot strives to support the native ecosystem through collaborative relationships and has a proven track record of allocating incentives to facilitate sustainable growth and long-term liquidity for ecosystem protocols.


This proposal will focus on bringing new protocols into the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting the adoption of $ARB as a base asset, and enhancing spot liquidity for Arbitrum native builders. This approach aligns with Arbitrum’s core values and aims to facilitate substantial and long-lasting growth.


Camelot has achieved a total trading volume of >$3,250,000,000 and has maintained a TVL of over $50m for several months. Most importantly, Camelot’s ecosystem-focused approach has yielded impressive results which can be seen by the data below, which clearly shows how Camelot generates sizeable fees through its dynamic and sustainable approach to liquidity. Camelot’s strong focus on partnerships and bringing in new protocols has introduced pools such as $DMT, $WINR, $AURY, $PENDLE, and many more to Arbitrum. Additionally, concentrated liquidity integrations such as Merkl have allowed for highly efficient returns on blue-chip pools like ETH/USDC and ARB/USDC too.


Through this multi-faceted approach to liquidity, Camelot can continue to scale sustainable liquidity for Arbitrum, introduce new protocols to the ecosystem, achieve broader adoption for $ARB, and generate attractive but long-lasting fees for users too. These objectives, when combined, will bolster Arbitrum’s position as the leading L2 ecosystem for DeFi innovation.


To summarise, Camelot will foster growth and innovation on Arbitrum through liquidity incentives in several ways:




50% of the incentives will be allocated towards partner pools and will be distributed using Camelot’s sustainable methodology that has achieved significant results


20% of the incentives are allocated to $ARB, specifically to broaden its adoption as a base asset within partner token pools, increasing utility whilst incentivising growth


20% to core pairs to establish highly efficient and deep liquidity on the native ecosystem trading venue, spurring network effects from protocols that leverage Camelot’s core pools (such as ALMs, yield protocols, lending markets and more)


With 10% reserved for new protocols, this grant will be used to attract new builders and protocols into the ecosystem, with Camelot acting as the natural entry-point for many teams. New projects will also receive our full marketing, community, and ecosystem support, in addition to any incentives.


Camelot can support any token in a bespoke way - v3 pools can be incentivised with integrations such as Merkl and ALMs such as Gamma, achieving some of the most efficient AMM returns. V2 Pools are also still one of the most practical solutions for new teams and therefore partners can leverage our custom Nitro pool infrastructure.


Camelot’s unique approach to concentrated liquidity will also allow for partner protocols to transition their tokens to more efficient rewards structures. Although v2 pools can be the most effective or practical option for long tail assets, we’re committed to supporting teams as they expand and deepen their overall liquidity on the chain.




Justification for the size of the grant:


Camelot is a top 3 native dapp by TVL and active users, and it has a proven track record of achieving sustainable growth, onboarding new protocols to the Arbitrum ecosystem, fostering collaboration, and distributing incentives in an effective way.


As shown in the table below, Camelot has a broad range of pools with varying liquidity profiles and requirements. Camelot can ensure that the requested $ARB incentives will be allocated in an objective and diverse way, in order to achieve deeper liquidity and efficient fee generation across numerous partner pools as well as blue-chip core pools.


As detailed in this application, Camelot has a multi-faceted strategy to achieve its objectives. To achieve these various objectives, different methods of distribution and incentivisation are required, and therefore the requested amount is justified by tackling the core points:




Expanding Arbitrum by incentivising new partners and protocols


Increasing the adoption of $ARB as a base asset for native protocols


Furthering the liquidity of $ARB and other core pools with the most efficient concentrated liquidity rewards structure


Deepening liquidity for native builders, stimulating economic growth for ecosystem protocols




The below data (and document under ‘execution strategy’ displays Camelot’s ability to achieve sustainable liquidity and fee generation, even in periods of weak market conditions. This data combined with the diverse distribution of incentives will allow Camelot to achieve broad and long-term growth for the Arbitrum ecosystem.


900×700 30.1 KB


Execution Strategy:


As mentioned throughout the application, Camelot will incentivise liquidity pools across several main categories, with pool-level granularity included in the below spreadsheets. This distribution is fully aligned with the detailed objectives and KPIs.


CAMELOT GRANT ALLOCATION BREAKDOWN


The spreadsheet attached above provides an initial outline for the first epoch distribution. It is important to note that this is based on current market conditions and therefore specific pool allocations can be slightly adjusted before a finalized distribution is confirmed. Examples of these adjustments would include distributing incentives to a v3 pool instead of v2, or adding pools from new partners. The total amount per category won’t change.


The distribution of incentives will be reported at the end of every epoch (two-week period), and will include a pool-level breakdown of the key metrics (TVL, fees, volume, amount of incentives received) to accurately and transparently assess performance. This report will therefore determine the following epoch’s incentive distribution, to most effectively achieve the KPIs and objectives.


CAMELOT GRANT EPOCH REPORT (example for reference purposes only, real data to be input once first epoch live)


Grant Timeline:


Camelot will begin distributing the incentives as soon as the tokens are received in the multisig. This will commence the first epoch (two-week period), with the mentioned reports and data being shared on an ongoing basis in-line with the timing of the following epoch token distributions to Camelot.


The distribution of incentives will be executed as per the allocation breakdown document on an epoch basis, and will continue for the 3 month period of the framework (At the latest up until January 31st 2024).

The pools that will be incentivized as part of the active liquidity program (200k) will be created via the factory: 
0xAE4fB6622F25f397587F11638dA8CE88C27b5645


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Premia would use the ARB tokens to incentivize options trading volume on the Premia Platform.




A majority 600k would be used to incentivize vault deposits on the platform directly. This, in turn, will allow for more option writing. We will target 10mm in new Liquidity into the vaults and in addition Premia will also match 550,000 Premia Tokens as part of the Premia Option Liquidity Mining program during the same time frame. At current levels that is an approx yield of ~20% annually, plus premiums collected from trading and we think is a fair return for passive liquidity providers.


200k ARB tokens would be used to incentivize traders that provide liquidity with range orders on the AMM. This will be calculated off-chain based on the volume traded, tightness of spread, and the pro-rata amount of range order liquidity provided within the most traded pools. This will be calculated in similar fashion to how 
Sushiswap & Angle Labs
 reward Liquidity Providers based on trading ranges.


100k ARB tokens will be used to match Options Liquidity Mining for other Protocols that choose to launch an incentive plan (as available via stream).  Premia calls this suite the 
Hydraulic Solutions Framework
. For Arbitrum native projects that choose to launch an Options Liquidity Mining program on Premia, we will further incentivize their contributions from this pool.




From Premia Treasury: 500k ARB tokens would be directly deposited into the ARB CALL Short Volatility Vault, (funded by Premia Treasury) to enable more liquidity for ARB Call options. Any yield or premiums collected on this deposit would then be reinvested into the system via our Academy Learn to Earn program, which will be highlighted during our 
Arbitrum Odyssey Week
.


Objectives
:




Increase daily options trading volume on the Arbitrum exclusive Premia Blue exchange by [500%] (Premia Blue just launched so 2mm daily is feasible)


Attract [3000] new users to trade options on Premia Blue and Arbitrum through joint marketing campaigns with other Vol Products on Arbitrum (Rysk, Jones, Etc).


Increase the Total Value Locked (TVL) in Premia Blue.



Incentivize LPs to provide [10mm] options liquidity






Promote education on options trading through Premia Academy incentives



[5000] Number of Premia Academy course completions


NOTE: Premia will incentivize this via any premiums collected on the ARB vault deposit as well as the 300k already deposited from the Premia Treasury.






Foster a robust community around the Premia Blue ecosystem.



Foster a strong community of options traders with [1000] new Discord members


Foster a strong community of options traders with [1000] new Twitter followers


NOTE: Premia will incentivize these two metrics via our Missions Platform and will be paid by the Premia Treasury, not the grant.








Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
:




Increase in TVL & Volume



Options trading volume


Options liquidity provided






User adoption rate



Number of new traders






Community engagement metrics



Number of Premia Academy course completions






Arbitrum Transaction Volumes



Gas Spent with Premia Smart Contracts on Arbitrum One

How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
:


Receiving this grant would enable Premia to provide incentives for liquidity providers that may not enter the options space unless the juice is worth the squeeze. With additional liquidity, the pricing of options will be more competitive and in alignment with centralized exchanges like Deribit (Premia’s Order Book Fees match that of Deribit) and that in turn will help us streamline the process of attracting centralized exchange traders to dip their toes in DeFi. Premia is confident in our ability to establish relationships with both protail and institutional players, the current hurdle is the low vol environment, and the lack of onchain liquidity to the options space holistically. Additionally, we will continue to work together with other Options Protocols on Arbitrum to attract new informed & responsible vol traders. Premia has showcased their commitment to knowledge and education with their academy program that has over 2000 hours spent learning on the platform, and will continue to invest in and expand the academy offering.

1414×530 56.9 KB


Justification for the size of the grant
: Premia has ambitious goals to utilize this Grant amount to expand the breadth of Options Traders in the Arbitrum Ecosystem. Based on historical platform volumes for the last 2 years on Arbitrum, as well as the requests from similar projects, we believe this to be a fair allocation, targeting modest returns, however happy to have an open discussion.


Execution Strategy
:




Allocate 600k ARB to passive liquidity providers who deposit in the Vault products.



The 6 current vaults (more to come) emit tokens based on vxPremia voting allocations.  Premia will utilize this allocation method to also distribute the ARB granted tokens.


Incentives will be distributed as streamed, moving from the multisig to the vaults on a regular basis.






Allocate 200k ARB to active liquidity providers.



Distribute pro-rata based on the user’s facilitation of the total volume on a biweekly cadence


This will allow for better pricing on ARB Call Options, and allow for other protocols to experiment with advanced cross protocol strategies having competitively priced premiums.


Any premiums collected from selling ARB call options will be reinvested into Premia’s learn to earn program to grow the userbase of responsible options traders.


Based on current deposit, this would increase pool liquidity 50% (as of today’s numbers)






Utilize the remaining 100k to match new Options Liquidity Mining Programs (OLM)



Premia built OLM in a modular way to easily spin up a new primitive to the traditional liquidity mining programs available. It allows for Protocols to spin up OLM easily, using the Premia suite of smart contracts and marketplace rails in a simple manner. There are a few protocols excited to utilize this new feature set after Premia goes live with their program this week. Below is an example of one way this primitive can be used.

Increase the number of users that onboard Arbitrum via OpenOcean to 100k (75k so far)


Achieve 10+ new projects utilizing OpenOcean swap API/Widget/SDK for inter-protocol integrations on Arbirtum




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:






New User Acquisition: OpenOcean’s cross-chain swap aggregator will help to attract users to Arbitrum from over 7 different chains (with more to come this Q4).

We hope to incentivise users to bridge, trade and start their Arbitrum experience through OpenOcean by providing campaigns, educational material and an easy user onboarding experience from another chain or from Fiat.






User Activation and Retention: We aim to keep users active and engaged by offering incentives and access to the deepest liquidity possible on-chain. New Arbitrum DEX LP’s and trending tokens will be continually added on an ongoing basis providing users more opportunities to use OpenOcean as their one-stop trading partner.






User Referrals: We plan to introduce a referral program that incentivizes users to invite others and share their experience on Arbitrum. This program seeks to attract new users to the ecosystem and encourage existing users to actively participate in current events, fostering a sense of community and growth. Refer to our 
previously successful referral program here. 






Boost Trading Volumes for OpenOcean and integrated Arbitrum DEXs: Through integration with all the DEXs in the Arbitrum ecosystem, we anticipate a significant increase in trading volume for each of them, aided by swap incentives we have distributed from the grants. Our platform’s ability to source liquidity from various decentralized exchanges will enhance Arbitrum’s overall trading ecosystem, making it more vibrant, competitive and easy to use for first-time aggregatees






Attracting New Projects to onboard Arbitrum : OpenOcean plans to attract high-quality projects to Arbitrum by offering access to API/SDK/Widget and dev resources for inter-protocol integrations as well as attracting multichain projects which are currently not yet deployed on Arbitrum. Through the grant, we will provide projects with the necessary tools and co-partnership incentives for end users to help build and innovate on Arbitrum for now and for the future of the network. By working with new on-chain deployments we can make sure we are systematically contributing towards building the best on-chain ecosystem possible and pushing for the sustainable success of Arbitrum and L2 Ethereum scaling goals.






Justification for the size of the grant:


OpenOcean is one of the most widely used and far reaching aggregators in the Defi world. The platform sits strategically positioned to attract, guide and support the next wave of crypto users from 2024 and beyond. Doesn’t matter if you’re a trader, LST staker, web3 gamer, NFT hoarder or chart aficionado, OpenOcean is the crypto-swiss-army-knife every DeFi and crypto user needs.


Since launching on Arbitrum, OpenOcean has held a historic track record of helping to promote and foster positive growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem. From incentive programs and awareness campaigns to onboarding new multichain protocols and launching dedicated tooling on Arbitrum, our ambitions aren’t limited to just indexing liquidity. With every new development, tweak or routing update we push, we try to support as many users as possible, Arbitrum has always been a chain where we look to launch new features first.


For reference, here’s a quick look into our existing stats showcasing our existing impact on Arbitrum ecosystem:




Collectively executed $344m+ volume on Arbitrum with 275k+ transactions


OpenOcean has served 75k unique wallets on Arbitrum


Integrated 53 liquidity sources across the ecosystem, the most of any aggregator


Partnered with leading DeFi protocols in the ecosystem offering products from our swap and builders suite, such as MetaMask, DeFiLlama, Camelot, GMX, Vela, Interport, 
Li.Fi
, ZyberSwap.


Launched 2 major successful quests on Arbitrum with 
145k+ participants
 and 
134k+ participants




Execution Strategy:


Given our role as a leading DEX aggregator featuring smart routing, the uplift in trading and user volumes we drive will benefit not only our platform, but will also be channeled to all DEXs on Arbitrum via our smart routing. This creates a mutual win, boosting the whole Arbitrum ecosystem.


1. Swap Trading Cost Rebates (35%):


Allocation: 35% of the grant will be dedicated to swap trading cost rebates within the Arbitrum ecosystem.


Execution: We will deploy these cost rebates strategically to enhance trading activity within Arbitrum. These incentives will be structured to attract traders to participate actively on Arbitrum-based decentralized exchanges.


Use of Funds: The funds allocated for swap trading cost rebates will be used to provide refund to users based on their trading volumes and trading frequency.


Risk Management: To manage the risks associated with rebates, we will closely monitor the effectiveness of the program through regular data analysis. Adjustments to the rebate structure will be made if necessary to ensure that the program achieves its intended goals. Also on-chain monitor will help block any suspicious bot activity.


2. Inbound Cross-Chain Swap Incentives (20%):


Allocation: Another 20% of the grant will be allocated to inbound cross-chain swap incentives.


Execution: We will use these incentives to attract users from various blockchain networks to Arbitrum. OpenOcean’s cross-chain swap aggregators will play a pivotal role in this process. Users will be incentivized to explore Arbitrum by providing cross-chain swap incentives.


Use of Funds: The funds will be used to provide incentives for users who migrate their assets from other chains to Arbitrum. This will involve designing attractive reward structures that encourage cross-chain activity.


Risk Management: To mitigate risks, we will closely monitor the success of these incentives in attracting users from other chains to prevent bots involved.


3. Referral Program Incentive Emission (20%):


Allocation: 20% of the grant will be dedicated to the implementation of a referral program.


Execution: Our referral program is designed to drive more traffic and active new users to Arbitrum contracts, aligning with incentivizing existing user interaction within the Arbitrum network.


Distinct from other referral programs, Referrers will receive ARB tokens from our contract via a user-friendly UI, equivalent to up to 50% of their gas fees on Arbitrum, and the referred gets up to 40% rebate, paid in ARB tokens, this will directly foster interaction with Arbitrum contracts.


The referral program’s distribution and calculations are trackable on-chain. We already have the system and UI ready, the next step is to integrate it with Arbitrum to enable payments in ARB. Refer to our 
previously successful referral program here.


We will implement anti-Sybil Attack measures and prohibit self-invites to maintain the program’s integrity.


Use of Funds: The allocated funds will be used to provide referral rewards and bonuses to users who refer others to Arbitrum. This will stimulate organic growth and community engagement.


Risk Management: The success of the referral program will be monitored closely through user participation and growth metrics. Adjustments will be made once we detect potential Sybil Attack.


4. Partnership Incentive Program to traders(25%):


Allocation: The remaining 25% of the grant will be dedicated to a partnership incentive program to end users of partner projects.


Execution: The purpose of the “Partnership Incentive Program to traders” segment is to attract more partners to join the Arbitrum ecosystem and to draw partners’ users to Arbitrum through the integration of OpenOcean‘s easy-to-use Arbitrum API/SDK & Widget.


We will initiate integration with wallets, DeFi projects, decentralized game projects, and any other projects on Arbitrum that may involve trading function to realize this goal.


Due to market fluctuations, we will disclose the addresses of the contracts we intend to incentivize upon completion of the integration process.


Use of Funds: Funds will be used to support co-partnership incentive program to traders, joint initiatives, and rewards for users of partner projects that enhance the Arbitrum network. This will foster a collaborative environment and attract high-quality projects to onboard Arbitrum.


Risk Management: The success of partnerships will be measured by the number of integrations and the impact of partner projects on Arbitrum’s ecosystem. Ongoing communication with partners will ensure the effective use of funds and alignment with shared goals.


Grant Timeline:


We plan to allocate and distribute the ARB from the STIP grant over a period of 4 months (estimated from October 2023 to January 2024, as per the program requirements). The start date and end date are dependent on when the grant is finally received.

How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?


1) Support Builders


Liquidity is the lifeblood of DeFi ecosystems. This grant will help to enhance and deepen spot liquidity, allowing Trader Joe to offer a more stable and efficient exchange experience that directly benefits the builders whom the markets support. Since its expansion to the Arbitrum network, Trader Joe has already enhanced liquidity for several key Arbitrum protocols. This has been achieved through sustainable reward distributions from its bespoke Market Maker incentive program, utilizing its custom-designed Automated Market Maker (AMM) known as Liquidity Book.


2) Signal Growth


The Arbitrum DAO prides itself as a neutral and open governing body, upholding the values of interoperation and open innovation. As such, Trader Joe plans to use this grant to support both long-standing and newly launched protocols native to Arbitrum One but also those who have deployed to Arbitrum One. Trader Joe believes that by supporting multi-chain protocols that have shown commitment towards Arbitrum, this will signal to the wider DeFi landscape that Arbitrum can be a home to builders who have yet to deploy here. With this grant, Trader Joe will aim to directly bolster Arbitrum’s standing as the go-to Layer 2 platform for innovation in the DeFi space.


3) Grow the Arbitrum User Base


Trader Joe aims to leverage the incentives granted to attract a larger and more diverse user base to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Utilizing its unique multi-chain position alongside previously delivered growth campaigns, Trader Joe will amplify the network effects of the allocated grant incentives via an Arbitrum Adventure branded Marketing Campaign. This approach will see resources committed from the Trader Joe ecosystem to raise awareness with the aim of creating a ripple effect that drives user acquisition for the Arbitrum Ecosystem. The phased approach to incentivization outlined in the below execution strategy, will complement the efforts of new user acquisition as Marketing efforts will be timed with each phase transition. The goal is to champion Arbitrum as a vibrant hub ripe with activity, benefiting all participants within the ecosystem.


Justification for the size of the grant:


Trader Joe has built a reputable and trusted name in the space through a commitment to long-lasting, collaborative relationships and a community-first approach. In addition, Trader Joe has a track record of continuous product innovation and has maintained high safety and security standards. Since deploying to Arbitrum, Trader Joe has signaled a significant level of commitment to the ecosystem by not only fostering a great trading and liquidity experience, but also launching 
community focused efforts
 to grow Arbitrum with continued community campaigns to be launched and aligned with the 
Arbitrum Odyssey
.


Trader Joe offers a unique DEX experience on Arbitrum with its custom AMM, Liquidity Book. This novel primitive discretizes liquidity, enabling on-chain zero slippage trade execution and surge pricing for liquidity providers. It also offers a granular, hyper-manageable liquidity provision experience. Liquidity Providers using Liquidity Book get full control and precision when managing liquidity where and when it’s needed, making it an excellent hub for liquidity that champions both efficiency and composability. Liquidity Book to date has facilitated over $3.15bn in trading volume on Arbitrum and the Decentralized Exchange has welcomed over 470k unique wallets.


The grant request of 1,510,000 ARB tokens will be utilized to foster and support liquidity growth of key builders that have demonstrated a strong commitment to scaling Arbitrum, and/or have introduced genuine product innovation that has helped to shape the diversity of the Arbitrum One ecosystem. To date this year over 1,400,000 JOE emissions have been utilized towards Arbitrum. Trader Joe will continue to support builders with JOE emissions moving forward.


Execution Strategy:


Trader Joe’s execution strategy will see 100% of the allocated grant distributed as liquidity mining incentives that will be distributed fully to Liquidity Providers by two incentivization forms, both are unique to the Trader Joe platform and, combined, uphold the values of efficiency, sustainability and accessibility.

1) Liquidity Book Rewards (Market Maker Incentive Program): Grant % allocated 66.23%


The Liquidity Book Rewards program was first introduced on Arbitrum and has successfully completed 12 Epochs since its inception on February 8th. This program incorporates a unique incentive mechanism through a competitive scoring system, known as the ‘MakerScore’. It encourages liquidity providers to manage their assets more efficiently, enabling them to earn increased trading fees and boost their MakerScore. A higher MakerScore translates to a larger portion of the available rewards. By introducing a competitive element to yield farming with concentrated liquidity, the program promotes sustainability and benefits builders by enhancing the depth of spot liquidity which improves the trading experience by enabling more swaps to execute with zero slippage thanks to the innovations of the Liquidity Book AMM.


Every liquidity provider who deposits into a participating liquidity pool is evaluated over the entirety of an Epoch in which they participate, with each Epoch lasting 14 days and each phase containing two Epochs. At the conclusion of each Epoch, The MakerScore is calculated for all participating liquidity providers. These rewards are then distributed to eligible liquidity providers through a smart contract, which vests the rewards over the duration of 7 days. Liquidity providers who have rewards to claim, can do so directly from the liquidity pool page where they accrued them.




Full details for how this program works in its entirety, including formulas used can be found 
here


All MakerScore calculations for every Epoch are published for public view 
here




Each incentivized partner pool will have rewards allocated in one of the three phases, enabling a focused selection of protocols for each phase that aids user discovery and concentrates reward effectiveness. Trader Joe proposes incentives to the following builders on account of key factors demonstrated, such as proven commitment, contribution and product innovation for the Arbitrum ecosystem.

2) Auto-Pools (Automated Liquidity): Grant % allocated 23.84%


As a DEX that is supporting liquidity for Arbitrum builders, deep spot liquidity for core pairs is important to ensure that users can seamlessly trade in and out of core tokens with high efficiency.


Auto-Pools is the latest product innovation by Trader Joe. They are designed to automate the balancing of liquidity in a Liquidity Book pool, offering users a highly accessible way to access concentrated liquidity, without the requirement to directly manage a position. Auto-Pools are utilized for core ‘blue chip’ pairs and will serve as an accessible way for users to access Arbitrum Token liquidity mining rewards via a one-click yield farming experience, whilst also supporting the core trading routes that serve all builders and participants in the Arbitrum One ecosystem.


The allocated incentives will be spread evenly across the total incentive period of 3 months and the rewards will be streamed in a linear distribution that is uninterrupted over that complete timeframe. Over 10% of the allocated grant will be put towards the ARB/ETH pair to ensure robust liquidity throughout the incentivization period.

3) New to Arbitrum Builder Allocation (via Market Making Incentives): 9.93%


Trader Joe proposes allocating 150,000 ARB (9.93% of the grant) to support new builders who either launch on Arbitrum during the incentivization period or deploy to it within the same timeframe. This allocation aims to bolster the growth of the Arbitrum Ecosystem by providing crucial early-stage support to promising projects, ensuring their long-term success. Trader Joe has consistently welcomed new builders to Arbitrum and this allocation directly aligns with the Arbitrum DAO’s objectives of expanding the ecosystem.


Any unused ARB would be returned at the end of the proposed incentivization period.


Grant Matching: JOE allocation committed up to 348k tokens


As part of the proposed KPI framework, Trader Joe will assess each participating Liquidity Pool 28 days following the end of the incentivization period for that specific Liquidity Pool. If the average TVL over a rolling 7d period falls below 25% of the peak measured TVL over a rolling 7d period during the incentivization period, JOE incentives equivalent to 10% ($ value) of the ARB tokens allocated to the pool will be distributed for a minimum of 2 weeks to a maximum of 4 weeks.


Grant Timeline:


Execution of the incentives will be structured over 3 phases, each lasting 28 days that run consecutively. Breakdown of the phases and reward allocations across the incentive mechanisms can be viewed above in the Execution Strategy.




Phase 1: Starting from when the grant is received and last for 28 days


Phase 2: Starts immediately after Phase 1 has finished and lasts for 28 days


Phase 3: Same as above, lasting for 28 days


Entire distribution of incentives: 84 consecutive days




Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?


Yes - We acknowledge the linearity of the incentives and the possibility of their altering. In case incentives would be halted the incentives granted till that time will be fully distributed according to the proposed schedule in proportion to the amount received for the specific epoch.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size
: We are requesting 750,000 $ARB tokens from the Short-Term Incentive Program.


Grant Matching
: These incentives will be overlaid on our regular incentive schedule, 300 000 LODE tokens being emitted to the markets every month (200,000 starting december).


Please refer to 
LODE - Docs
 for additional information.


Grant Breakdown
:






95% of the grant (712 500 ARB) will be distributed among all market participants (the term “market participants” refers to depositors and borrowers in the Lodestar markets and does not include LODE liquidity providers or stakers). Each market participant is entitled to proportional ARB rewards based on the ETH value of their deposits and borrows relative to the ETH value of all deposits and borrows. See “Execution Strategy” in Section 3 for additional information.






5% of the grant (37 500 ARB) will be distributed among all emission gauge participants, proportionally to their voting participation.






In the interest of the protocol’s security, we will distribute ARB incentives weekly as an airdrop as the protocol does not have an innate ability to emit tokens other than LODE.


We are dedicating 100% of this grant to incentives as we have also applied to an Arbitrum Foundation grant to support our operational and security expenses.

Contract Address
: N/A


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives
: We aim to use the funds from the grant to incentivize depositing and borrowing activity in the Lodestar Markets and the participation to our emission gauge to shape the protocol.


By providing depositors with more attractive yields and borrowers with cheaper borrow interest rates, we expect these incentives to improve the general available liquidity in the lending markets. This will allow users to deploy their assets more efficiently, but also support Protocols that are facilitating leveraged yield-bearing strategies such as looping with wstETH or plvGLP in an even more effective way.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
:


We believe that the main KPIs to measure the success of the grant are:


Total Value Locked (“TVL”):




Growth in the total deposits on the Protocol


Growth in the total deposits of yield-bearing assets




User Count:




Total number of weekly users


Total amount of staked $LODE and vote participation




We also believe that there is value in tracking the utilization rate of Lodestar Finance. Growth in the utilization rate would imply competitive interest rates, trust in the Protocol and desirable assets.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
:


By offering an alternative destination for tokenholders to deploy their native application tokens, we will be able to support applications in:




Allowing native yield-bearing assets to be even more competitive with assets in other ecosystems by virtue of the leveraged looping of these assets;


Retaining a larger user base and tokenholder population; and


Reducing supply-side pressure on their token which supports their Protocol’s growth and adoption.




We also believe that these incentives will introduce users to our unique emission gauge system that empowers users and DAOs to shape the money market.


By lending or borrowing on Lodestar, users receive LODE tokens that they can stake to earn ETH from the protocol’s revenues.


Additionally, every week, those who lock their LODE can vote and direct the next week’s emissions to the market of their choice, on either the borrow or supply side. Since its launch 4 weeks ago, we have witnessed LODE lockers shaping the protocol, enhancing their yield strategies by incentivising either the borrow side to lower the cost of their leveraged strategies or increasing the interest gained on the supply side to increase the yield they are generating.


With the increased liquidity from these incentives and the composability of our markets, we look forward to seeing other developers build on top of the Lodestar markets and participate in the above mechanics to shape the liquidity to their needs.


Justification for the size of the grant
:


As per the Forum post, the Arbitrum Working Group has created four grant categories with advisory caps implemented on them. Lodestar Finance currently falls into the Siren Grants category having launched in Apr-2023 (5 months ago) with c.$14m in deposits. We believe we lie at the higher end of this category by virtue of almost being on the threshold for the next categorisation, the Lighthouse Grant. Moreover, we have also spent long periods of time above the TVL threshold to fall into the next category.


We also note that we have reached this scale without having been a recipient of the ArbitrumDAO airdrop demonstrating our ability to compete with other protocols for liquidity.


Execution Strategy
:

Lodestar plans to distribute the granted funds through the following process:






Market and gauge participants will be compensated directly with $ARB tokens for their participation in the protocol.






Eligible rewards are proposed to be calculated in the following manner:




The amount of $ARB tokens distributed weekly will be the total amount of $ARB granted divided by the number of weeks until the incentive program stops in January 2024.


Two snapshots will be taken each week, one during the first half and one during the second half. The timings of the snapshots will not be publicly disclosed to prevent users from gaming the rewards system.


For each protocol user, weekly $ARB distribution is calculated by taking the sum of their total supply and borrow balances (in $ETH) and dividing by the Protocol’s total supply and borrowed balances (in $ETH).


The user’s final weekly eligible rewards will be the average of eligible rewards between snapshots.


A third snapshot will be taken at the end of the epoch to calculate the users’ voting power and participation








The user’s calculated eligible rewards will be airdropped directly to their wallet.






The Lodestar team will monitor the distributions each week and create ways to report useful metrics to the public.






Grant Timeline
:


We plan to deploy the incentives over a period of 16 epochs until the end of the campaign in January 2024 (4 months):


Week 1 - October 22nd: 46,875 $ARB airdrop


Week 2 - October 29th: 46,875 $ARB airdrop


Week 3 - November 5th: 46,875 $ARB airdrop

SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Provide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?
: Lodestar Finance is native to Arbitrum and has not expressed any interest in deploying on any other blockchain.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?
: n/a - Lodestar Finance does not have any deployments on any other blockchains


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?
: Lodestar Finance launched on Arbitrum in April 2023.


Protocol Performance
:


Lodestar Finance is a money market deployed natively on Arbitrum. The money market aims to provide first-class infrastructure to native Arbitrum assets such as MAGIC and GMX, as well as blue-chip assets in the Ethereum ecosystem. It has also found a niche by facilitating money markets for yield-bearing assets including those native to Arbitrum such as plvGLP and wstETH.


It is governed by the Lodestar DAO and is 100% community owned and funded. With c.$14m in deposits today, Lodestar Finance is still the largest native money market on Arbitrum. At its peak, Lodestar Finance had over $50m in deposits, showcasing the desire for our product within the ecosystem.


Furthermore, the $LODE token has demonstrated positive value accrual with the Protocol earning c.$90k fees since launch. After the launch of the staking module, the Protocol commenced distribution of a portion of market revenue, with approximately 40% of the circulating supply staked, earning an average 35% APR paid in ETH.


The Lodestar Protocol also became one of the first money markets to implement an emissions gauge to direct incentives to deposit and borrow pools, enabling user-driven dynamic market emissions. To date, the emissions gauge is currently in its fifth weekly epoch.


It is also worth noting that the Lodestar DAO was not a recipient of the ArbitrumDAO airdrop as the protocol was offline from December 2022 to April 2023. This meant that the Protocol was competing with other incentivised protocols for liquidity and still maintained positive growth in less than favorable market conditions.

Defillama Dashboard: 
https://defillama.com/protocol/lodestar-finance


Protocol Roadmap
:


The introduction of the weekly gauge system to our staking module empowers stakers in shaping the money market. We envision protocols, DAOs and users building vaults and individual strategies on top of Lodestar Finance, stockpiling their $LODE emissions earned to give them more control over the destination of future emissions.


Staking $LODE tokens presents a two-fold advantage for third parties using the protocol. First, they have the potential to earn a real yield from the application’s revenue, denominated in WETH. Second, and equally significant, is their ability to direct emissions. This mechanism has been envisioned to produce a reinforcing cycle: as stakers reap the benefits of yields and have a say in emission directions, it logically follows that they could accumulate a larger quantity of $LODE tokens.


Currently, discussions are underway with several protocols that are leveraging the Lodestar markets and infrastructure to build new and interesting products such as automated strategies or utilizing our yield-bearing assets in novel ways. These protocols can also take part in the emissions voting system to enhance the yields for their own products.


Additionally, development efforts at Lodestar have been focused on building a module and interface for a protocol bribing system. This system aims to provide benefits for all participants in the Lodestar staking and emissions voting systems. LODE stakers will be able to earn a yield on their available voting power and bribers can channel increased amounts of emissions voting power to their preferred strategies.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives:




To attract and onboard new users to Arbitrum.


To increase Arbitrum’s stablecoin market share.


To boost overall Arbitrum TVL
 by incentivising crypto-native yield solutions with enormous scale and wide appeal, for a variety of risk appetites.


To make Arbitrum the primary hub for putting large positions to work
, with Jones as the leader in spearheading safe and competitive yield strategies.


To increase participation in Jones Vaults
, which provide liquidity to underlying protocols and their users; boosting usability for products like perpetuals on GMX.




Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):




Overall TVL


DAUs


Number of transactions across Jones Vaults & liquid token markets.total value locked (TVL) in our smart contracts.


Value of individual wallets interacting with our smart contracts.


TVL arriving during the incentive period, TVL leaving after the incentive period, and long-term TVL retained after the incentive period.


Average deposit size and number of interactions before, during, and after incentives.




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?


Jones believes in a decentralized future, where novel financial tools enable positive-sum crypto-economics.


Arbitrum makes that vision possible.


New & existing users will frictionlessly benefit from systems that Arbitrum-native builders are creating right now. As an Arbitrum-native protocol, Jones is among those building that future.


This grant will allow Jones to onboard the next generation of DeFi by:


1) 
Providing the Bedrock of Decentralized Yield


In comparison to DAI’s DSR, which has allowed sDAI to soak up massive amounts of capital ($1.61B+) in a relatively short amount of time, 
Jones’ 7-day avg. yield for the jUSDC strategy almost always exceeds sDAI
. Plus, jUSDC is presently scalable to mid-9-figures with no impact on yield performance, putting us within striking distance of DSR TVL at max capacity.


Instead of users flocking to RWAs such as DAI’s DSR as a source of scalable stablecoin yield, let them come to jUSDC. Jones has built a crypto-native solution which utilizes Arbitrum-native protocols like GMX to accomplish the same goal, while outperforming the incumbents.


Incentivization of jUSDC deposits will invite throngs of users to remove the mental & practical hurdles necessary to bridge their capital to Arbitrum and take advantage of the jUSDC strategy. 
Stablecoin inflows from Ethereum Mainnet will significantly enhance TVL on Arbitrum
.


1600×562 263 KB

Similarly, various ETH LSTs provide 4-10% APY to users, enabling exposure to ETH price action as well as ETH yield, accounting for over $16B+ TVL. However, Jones’ unique architecture design makes jGLP a better offering. By leveraging the power of GLP, users get exposure to price action similar to ETH or BTC, while generating yield that often reaches high double digits. Yield is delivered in pure ETH, just like LST protocols. 7-day average yields have fluctuated between 6.96% and 120%, 
but always remained higher on average than most, if not all, of ETH LST yields
.


jGLP incentives, coupled with jUSDC incentives, enable jGLP to meet already excessive LST demand by drawing more deposits to the jGLP Vault. This expands how much jGLP can be minted against jUSDC, while attracting users seeking high-yielding exposure to ETH.


1600×566 261 KB


2) 
Enhancing Liquidity Infrastructure


Jones has a rich history of interoperability. In addition to boosting TVL on Arbitrum, these new incentives will trickle down to protocols building on top of Jones. Numerous lending markets are already plugged into jUSDC & jGLP, and an even greater number of protocols have plans in the works for current & future vaults.


ARB incentives directed to these lending markets invite users to take advantage of unique strategies, allowing them to increase, hedge, or diversify their exposure. These protocols benefit from an influx of TVL, while Arbitrum benefits from more users using more protocols, generating more sequencer fees in the process.


3) 
Positive-Sum Network Effects


The most successful strategies on Jones - jGLP & jUSDC - are built on top of GMX; the leading crypto protocol for perps on Arbitrum. These strategies are unique in that every new user added to jGLP and jUSDC has the dual benefit of achieving growth in TVL for both Jones and GMX. The more jUSDC deposits there are means that more room in jGLP can open up, and when new tokens are then deposited into jGLP, GLP TVL increases as stables from jUSDC are deployed to acquire more GLP tokens through the strategy’s automated smart leverage system.


This creates a flywheel for the growth of two of the most important protocols in Arbitrum, where each ARB token given to a new jGLP or jUSDC holder benefits Jones users and GMX users alike. More GLP liquidity enables more GMX utilization from large token deployers on GMX V1. Thus, incentivization of jUSDC & jGLP is extremely efficient, creating a network effect that sends new Arbitrum users to both protocols.


This is just one example of the win-win scenarios which Jones is capable of executing. With this grant, Jones hopes to incentivize more positive-sum flywheels, which will bring on more builders, users, and tokens.


Justification for the size of the grant:


1600×753 139 KB


Jones is one of the largest and oldest Arbitrum-native protocols, and after having serviced up to $50M TVL, it is no stranger to DAOs, whales, and institutions as vault users. We’ve listened to them, and we know what they need. To move the needle on boosting Arbitrum’s TVL in a noticeable way, the requested grant size needs to be sufficient to service the large number of users Jones hopes to attract to Arbitrum. Jones Vault yields must be boosted by competitive amounts to satisfy these new users.


The TVL of Jones DAO has grown astoundingly from $11M in January 2023 to $48M in February 2023, and has stayed above $30M for several months, with a slight decline in the last 30 days in line with the rest of TVL decline of the whole Arbitrum ecosystem.


Our most successful strategies, jGLP and jUSDC, have generated (block 55870678, beginning of February, to block 134564088, September) a yield of approximately 1079 ETH and 105,000 USDC since inception, for a notional average dollar value of $1.9M considering an average value of ETH of $1700 for the aforementioned period.


The quality of jGLP is universally recognized by users.


714×428 69.9 KB


If we look at the comparison chart, jGLP is the market leader when it comes to smart vaults built atop GLP.


Individual grant distribution justifications can be segmented as the following:




jGLP & jUSDC - 65% allocation




jGLP & jUSDC Vaults deliver transparent and consistent yield to users, powered by smart leverage. They work in tandem to amplify the yield generated by GLP for depositors.


The conclusion to request 1,300,000 ARB tokens for jGLP & jUSDC was a very logical one. This number correlates to the notional value of yield generated so far on these strategies. This is explained in the section above. 1.3M ARB tokens will essentially double the yield of both jUSDC & jGLP. In doing so, these vaults will become the premier yield strategies on Arbitrum, bringing in new users and growing TVL.


Jones is constantly innovating on strategy improvements. Over the course of this program, with increased TVL & usage, some developments may come about which allow us to expand the jGLP & jUSDC strategies. The protocol requests that the tokens may also be used in any future evolutions of these vaults that might arise during the incentive period.




wjAURA: - 17.5% allocation




jAURA is an auto-compounding & vote optimization strategy that allows depositors to earn yield on their AURA tokens. Over time, each jAURA token will become backed by more underlying vlAURA.


Aura has recently expanded to several chains, including Arbitrum. Despite jAURA’s current status as an Ethereum Mainnet strategy, the Jones team is close to completion of an upgrade for wjAURA that will allow deposits on Arbitrum. This 350,000 ARB token incentive will be given to depositors who bridge their wjAURA to Arbitrum, attracting greater AURA liquidity.


A specific staking contract will be created to distribute Arbitrum rewards to users who will bridge wjAURA from Ethereum Mainnet to Arbitrum. This new approach will help the most important Aura derivative to reach stability on Arbitrum, with the potential for developing further utility down the road.


From block 17335368 to block 18170066, the jAURA strategy generated a cumulative total yield of around 222k AURA since inception in mid-May. While it is difficult to quantify the notional dollar value due to market fluctuation; by taking the average token price of $1.54 from the time window of May - September, we can approximate that the vault generated $342k of yield for users. The 350k ARB will not only effectively double the yield, but also build a fantastic flywheel to help attract Aura users directly to Arbitrum.




MV2 & Smart LP Strategy: - 17.5% allocation




Jones’ Metavaults allow users to provide liquidity while also automatically hedging or slightly levering price action on underlying tokens, all powered by options. The Metavaults take LP positions to the next level, mitigating impermanent loss and utilizing powerful Arbitrum-native options platforms.


Metavaults found success in its first iteration, and plans are in effect for it to return with a revitalized architecture before the end of the year. Jones must direct incentives to MV2 in order to incentivize new LP holders & partners to bootstrap this novel approach for liquidity optimization. If successful, this strategy could be one of the biggest drivers of TVL & options volume that has ever existed on Arbitrum.


The Smart LP strategy that Jones is currently testing and is yet to be announced. It will allow users to provide liquidity on V3 exchange architecture in an automatic, algorithmic way. The strategy will automatically manage and periodically update the range of the LP based on specific market metrics, provide autocompound functionality, and put in place failsafe triggers to alter the range asynchronously if needed.


NOTE:
 If, due to external and unpredictable factors, neither the second iteration of Metavaults nor the Smart LP strategy releases by the end of 2023, Jones pledges that the 350,000 ARB tokens will be distributed amongst live strategies: jGLP, jUSDC, and jAURA.


Execution Strategy:


Jones’ execution strategy will supply 100% of ARB token incentives directly to Jones Vault users & lending strategies built upon Jones Vaults.


All work related to the distribution of ARB incentives will be undertaken & automated by Jones developers.


To recap, the proposed distribution is as follows:




jGLP & jUSDC: 
1.3M ARB


wjAURA: 
350k ARB


MV2 & Smart LP strategy: 
350k ARB




Total amount:
 
2M ARB


Incentives will be streamed to Jones Vault users as an APY on their vault position and claimable in a similar way to how yield from the vaults are currently claimed. Please interact with the Jones 
dApp
 for a demonstration.


The ARB rewards will all be distributed, starting mid/end October (pending precise date to the necessity of building and testing support infrastructure), up until the 31st January. The ARB will be distributed through processes that will match with the current yield distribution methods on Jones strategies. This means that: if a vault distributes the yield once per week, the ARB will be distributed once per week; if a vault distributes the yield constantly, the ARB will be streamed constantly.


Grant Timeline:


Incentives will be distributed evenly from the date they are granted, until the completion of the short-term incentives program, January 31, 2024.


For example, if the 2,000,000 ARB grant begins on October 15th, 2023, Jones will distribute ~18,527 ARB per day for 108 days through to January 31st, 2024.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size:


200k ARB


Grant Matching:


We intend to perform a 1:1 matching of the ARB grant received, with this matching amount to be used as Protocol-Owned Liquidity (“POL”) for our Basic Vaults, AMM, and Lending Market. We will acquire these assets (either ARB or ETH) through open market operations.


The initial breakdown of this 1:1 POL will be as follows:




Basic Vaults (Sell-side): ARB (12.5%) & ETH Call Vaults (22.5%)


AMM (Buy-side): ARB-Call / ARB Pool (20%), ETH-Call / ETH Pool (30%)


Lending Market (Short Options): 10%


Borrowing Market (Long Options): 5%




Grant Breakdown:




100% of grant proceeds will be used for the Thetanuts Finance v3 deployment for TVL incentives.


TVL Incentives are expected to be distributed to LPs in the Basic Vaults, AMM, and Lending Market – in order to bootstrap liquidity and kickstart the v3 flywheel.


The incentives will be split linearly across 3 months until 31 Jan 2024. Distribution of rewards for the AMM and Lending Market will commence upon deployment at a later date (estimated launch of Oct 2023).


All incentives from POL will be used for a future incentive program.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):




Total Users on Arbitrum


Monthly Active Users (MAU) on Arbitrum


Protocol Interactions by number of Arbitrum transactions


TVL on Arbitrum (Basic Vaults, AMM, and Lending/Borrowing)


Trading Volume (AMM)




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?


Thetanuts Finance has been looking for a more permanent home to launch our v3 protocol because cheap gas transactions are essential for both retail users and the execution of our new smart contracts.


For the longest time, we have seen Arbitrum as the most competitive ecosystem for onchain options in terms of user base and gas affordability. We have deployed our vaults on Arbitrum since April 2023, while quietly building behind the scenes. With our new v3 model (which we plan to launch in October 2023), we would have solved the buy-side dilemma for onchain options through the introduction of an AMM and lending market.


We will also prioritise seeking partnerships and building integrations with key Arbitrum protocols (e.g. GMX, Radiant, Camelot, Pendle, etc) to build out our option markets.


Here’s a sneak peek of what Thetanuts v3 will look like:


|643x397.1408078889046
1574×971 127 KB


And here’s a look at our new UI:


                        v3 UX for Trading Platform





                        v3 UX for Lending Market





We believe that this grant will help shed light on what DeFi options can offer by encouraging users to learn and use Thetanuts while providing a decentralized options marketplace for other protocols to issue options on their own tokens. By abstracting away the complexities of options trading, we will:




Allow native Arbitrum users and protocol to issue options on any token, allowing for a healthier derivative ecosystem to develop.


Generate increased on-chain activity on Arbitrum.


Cement Arbitrum’s position as the Centre of Excellence for DeFi Innovation and Options.




Justification for the size of the grant:


Our v3 is essentially three separate dApps operating under one ecosystem. There are currently (4) avenues where we can divert incentives towards to:




Basic Vaults (Sell-side)


AMM (Buy-side)


Lending Market (Lenders)


Lending Market (Borrowers)




We plan to distribute 100% of the rewards in a manner that bootstraps liquidity and kickstarts the v3 flywheel.


Execution Strategy:


We believe the best way to achieve in terms of incentive weights is as follows:




Basic Vaults (Sell-side): ARB (12.5%) & ETH Call Vaults (22.5%)


AMM (Buy-side): ARB-Call / ARB Pool (20%), ETH-Call / ETH Pool (30%)


Lending Market (Short Options): 10%


Borrowing Market (Long Options): 5%


Note that the Thetanuts Finance team may shift these weights depending on uptake of the various products.




The key to our ecosystem working is having enough liquidity in our AMM because it will allow users to enter/exit their options positions whenever they want, without waiting for the epoch to expire. LP users are, thus, the most important cog in our mechanism.


Basic Vaults are the next pillar because we need to attract market makers to buy options from our vaults. Users with smaller positions may then participate at more cost-efficient premiums. The lending market will also be incentivized but at a smaller rate because interest rates can be adjusted by the protocol .


Funds will be held and distributed through the following multisig address (2/3): 0xc3A48B40b3762924D6fa3af1D957cE78E522497E


Grant Timeline:


As we understand the process, 
“Successful applicants will receive funding distributions biweekly via Hedgey streams”
. We propose that the rewards (200k ARB tokens) be distributed evenly over from the starting date of distribution, until 31 Jan 2024.


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives:

The primary objective of this grant is to drive user adoption by introducing new users to the secure, fast and low-cost Arbitrum Ecosystem. We intend to showcase Arbitrum and its flourishing ecosystem of protocols and projects both to our diverse multi-chain user community, and to a wider pool of potential users through our marketing and promotions. Our proposal aims to implement a strategic rewards distribution approach that not only garners substantial participation but also yields measurable and impactful outcomes.


We believe that a clever, carefully-planned and consistent programme of incentives, deployed by experienced teams like Beefy, can dramatically improve the reach of blockchain projects and ecosystems. Our tried and tested formulas for deploying incentives have already yielded considerable value through our own initiatives and other grant funding; we look forward to expanding our existing work to focus more on the Arbitrum ecosystem.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):


Our experience working with large incentives programmes to date has shown us that a range of different indicators need to be considered together and in parallel to assess the performance of incentivized activities, both individually and in aggregate. Beefy has developed privacy-preserving, in-house analytics tooling that allows us to actively monitor and report on the following metrics:






total value locked (TVL) in our smart contracts;






volume and value of interactions with our smart contracts;






quantity of and value of individual users and wallets interacting with or with funds in our smart contracts;






user performance in each smart contract, including yield (i.e. regardless of price appreciation) and profit/loss (i.e. net of price appreciation) over time;






protocol performance from each smart contract, including fees and incentives paid from operations; and






value and volume of interactions using our peripheral services, such as our ZAP contracts (which facilitate optimal entry and exit from our smart contracts using any token obtained through swap aggregators like 1inch).






As Beefy is constantly monitoring these various metrics, we have access to a very large foundation of data (internally known as our “Data Barn”), which is used for analysis of our performance. In particular, the key performance indicators which we think demonstrate the effectiveness of incentives programmes well are:




TVL arriving during the incentive period, pre-staking (i.e. after announcement but before the incentives are live) and immediately after the incentive period;


Long-term TVL remaining in the smart contract at specific intervals after the incentive period, or even over multiple incentive programmes;


TVL departure during the incentive period (e.g. as the average incentive yield drops with adoption), at the end of the incentive period and immediately after the incentive period;


TVL change per incentivize token deployed, or per value of incentives deployed (e.g. in USD);


Proportion of new versus existing users/wallets engaging with: (1) the incentivized smart contract; (2) the incentivized protocol; (3) the incentivized chain; and (4) Beefy.


Average position size in the incentivized smart contracts before, during and after the incentive programme; and


Average number of interactions with the incentivized smart contracts before, during and after the incentive programme.




Given the amount and range of available data and options, our internal analysis tends to focus on the metrics and indicators that we think are most relevant in the context of the incentive programme. For example, brand new protocols or products require adjustments to account for the product finding product-market fit at the same time as the incentive programme (so expectations must vary significantly between launch and long term performance).


As such, we propose to provide reporting covering a variety of metrics and indicators discussed (and any others which are relevant), rather than to report routinely on static KPIs across all incentives programmes supported by the grant.


Our team may also develop dashboard(s) for the community to monitor the spending or performance of the grant, including with the metrics and KPIs detailed above. The precise scope and content of a dashboard would need to be agreed after the degree of funding is confirmed, and as part of Beefy’s implementation plans.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


Beefy is a gateway into DeFi. Many of our users feedback that Beefy’s straightforward autocompounding vault design and user-friendly interface made interacting with different types of DeFi products and protocols substantially easier for them, which in turn has encouraged them to dive deeper into the space as their confidence in Web 3.0 grows. Though the number of new users entering the space right now is significantly below peak levels, adoption nonetheless continues to build momentum. Offering exceptional incentivized yields on Arbitrum will encourage new users to enjoy their Web 3.0 experiences, by way of the fast and reliable Arbitrum experience that we all know and love. And ensuring these experiences are taking place on captivating and user-friendly applications will help solidify those early experiences into longstanding habits.


Beefy’s app is designed from the ground up to be natively multi chain. This is no simple task, as presenting data on hundreds of vaults, across 22 different blockchains, in a way that’s still enjoyable and easy to understand, is an enormous engineering challenge. However the end result fosters enormous growth, not only for users - who benefit from easy access to hundreds of protocols all across Web 3.0 - but also for protocols aiming to increase their visibility among existing audience.


The majority of the proposed budget for this grant is targeted at deploying incentives on top of Beefy’s Arbitrum vaults. Incentivized vaults will automatically move to the top of the Beefy’s app filters, leaving them on prime display to all users and visitors on Beefy’s site. In addition, each incentive programme tends to be accompanied by support from partner protocols who are being boosted, who typically assist Beefy with co-marketing, community engagement and sometimes matching incentive contributions. Ultimately, the idea is not only to boost the rewards of certain vaults, but also to educate new and existing users on the protocols and tokens involved in our campaigns, and how their yields are being generated.


Justification for the size of the grant:


As the largest yield optimizer on Arbitrum One - that’s held down tens of millions in TVL for years at the time of writing, Beefy is an adept and proven project for executing on and delivering value from grant funding. Equivalent efforts on other chains have seen Beefy run multiple long term campaigns simultaneously, whilst attracting and capturing millions in TVL as a result of our natively multi-chain audience. Our well-established incentive programmes can therefore easily and effectively put tens of thousands of incentives to use at any given time, and so we are requesting the maximum amount permitted.


We at Beefy share the same values as the broader Arbitrum ecosystem. We know and understand that Ethereum’s scalability is crucial to onboarding the next billion users. As one of the first protocols to deploy on Arbitrum One in September 2021, we have been working closely with core players from across the ecosystem for years to help Arbitrum become the thriving ecosystem it is today. With the support of significant grant funding, we at Beefy expect to continue fueling growth and exciting use cases on Arbitrum for the next two years.


Execution Strategy:


Our execution strategy is divided among there core categories:


(1) Boosts: The majority of the incentives (c. 85%) will be distributed through our Beefy “Boost” incentive campaigns. The standard duration for a boost is 28 days (though can vary), and the amount of tokens depends on the TVL of the pool, the contribution of the partners, the level of interest from the community and the general context. Beefy Boosts starts with a pre-stake period, accompanied with announcements through our social media channels to raise awareness. Rewards start accruing to users a few hours after. Due to the hands-off nature of Beefy users, after the boost finishes, many times users don’t withdraw, since the vaults still provides an underlying, unincentivized yield. Boosts will be run in partnership with other Arbitrum ecosystem projects, to support native and local tokens, liquidity and governance, and bolster the entire ecosystem.


(2) Bribes: As liquidity models have developed, many protocols have understood and adopted the liquidity flywheel which arises from allowing users to incentivize liquidity through incentive gauge voting, vote escrow and bribes. The Solidly model unlocks the power of bribes, by allowing early users to access disproportionate rates of incentives for minimal spend, and with incentives returning to the spender through rewards on veNFTs. Beefy has mastered the prevailing liquidity flywheel model, and works actively with a dozen or so partner decks to add moment, by providing liquidity, participating in gauge votes and conducting bribe campaigns. The proposed budget allocates c. 15% of funding to participate in the various core liquidity flywheels which power Arbitrum’s thriving DeFi ecosystem.


Grant Timeline:


This proposal aims to distribute the proposed amount of funding over the course of 4 months, at a relatively even pace in line with the streaming of incentives into the Beefy treasury through Hedgey. In that time, we plan to showcase at least 12 different Arbitrum partners, together with dozens of different vaults and tokens from all across the ecosystem.


The ultimate implementation of the protocol is flexible, and can respond to the needs of Arbitrum community and our users, though we anticipate that Arbitrum-centered incentive programme will run more or less non-stop throughout the 4 month funding period. We plan to demonstrate our performance against the above KPIs through live dashboards, and regular reporting, we also anticipate that there will be external sources of truth to demonstrate progress, such as the change in TVL for Beefy and its Arbitrum partners arising from our incentives campaigns.


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?
 Yes


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Provide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:


No. Beefy predates Arbitrum One’s launch. Instead, Beefy launched on BNB Chain in September 2020. Beefy arrived on Arbitrum One within the first month in September 2021.


Following the fall of Multichain, Beefy has migrated its $BIFI governance token to live natively on Ethereum and its rollups. Beefy has selected Arbitrum as a hub chain, through which it will route a majority of its revenue from other chains, and on which liquidity for the governance token will be actively supported.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?:




Avalanche


Base


BNB Chain


Canto


Cronos


Ethereum


Fantom


Fuse


Kava


Metis


Moonbeam


Moonriver


Optimism


Polygon PoS


Polygon zkEVM


zkSync




What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?:


20 September 2021


Protocol Performance:






Beefy has 200M of TVL of which 27M is on Arbitrum One (c. 13.5%)






The protocol had 1,000 transactions in the last 24 hours, of which 72 transactions were on Arbitrum One (c. 7.2%)






In terms of users, right now Beefy has 51,000 unique wallet addresses using the protocol, of which 15,500 hold positions in Arbitrum One (c. 30.4%)






Total revenue (including all revenue sources, e.g. validators) of $634,827 in the second quarter. $695,229 in the first quarter. Annualized this equates to $2,660,112.

Revenue from our Arbitrum One vaults was $49,542 for the second quarter, and $41,963 in the first quarter. Annualized this equates to $183,010, or around 7% of Beefy’s total revenue.






In terms of fees, Beefy’s fees are broken down into treasury revenue from vaults and vault fees dedicated to governance incentives. Beefy does not charge fees on its other sources of revenue.

Beefy’s total fees were $817,628 in the second quarter, and $738,647 in the first. This equates to $3,112,550 in fees on an annualized basis.

Beefy’s total fees attributable to Arbitrum One were $72,204 for the second quarter, and $64,867 in the first quarter, which equates to $274,142 in annualized fees (8.8% of total).

Fees dedicated to governance incentives from our Arbitrum vaults were $22,662 for the second quarter, and $22,905 in the first quarter. Annualized this equates to $91,132 in incentives arising from Optimism alone.

Protocol Roadmap:


Beefy generally does not adopt fixed roadmaps, in recognition of their limitations and propensity to distract from real operations on the ground. Instead, our decentralized contributor team tend to adopt various short-to-mid term plans covering our different competences and areas, and collectively focus on balancing priorities and timescales across the different competing areas.


With that backdrop in mind, our development team are currently focused on: (1) the completion of our

governance token migration beefy. com/articles/bifi-migration; (2) the rollout of concentrated liquidity products beefy. com/articles/beefy-cl; (3) the development of crosschain products beefy. com/articles/lz-aura; and (4) the development of new zap tooling beefy. com/articles/revolutionizing-beefy-zap-in-partnership-with-1inch. We are also constantly focusing on improving our interface and user experience, such as with new tooling like our Yield Module beefy. com/articles/insights-that-inspire-introducing-the-beefy-yield-module.


At the same time, our partnerships and marketing teams continue iterating on our core-product market fit by: (1) partnering with new chains and protocols; (2) promoting and boosting existing partner products and developments; (3) participating in incentivization and distribution of new/popular products/tokens; and (4) marketing the best of our products effectively to our target audience.


Separately our DAO is taking constant strides towards increasing transparency and safety across a very broad range of activities. For instance, in 2023 Beefy has: (1) adopting quarterly financial reporting beefy. com/articles/quarterly-report-q2-2023. to maximize transparency with respect to our operations; (2) implemented a Timelock Monitor service beefy. com/articles/safeguarding-in-plain-sight-the-beefy-timelock-monitor. to watch for upgrades in protocols incorporated into Beefy; (3) adopted a new Treasury Dashboard beefy. com/articles/offering-true-transparency-with-beefy-s-treasury-dashboard. to display live information about our DAO’s assets.


Audit History:


Beefy has undertaken 6 audits for our existing autocompounding vaults, which are all available in the our audits GitHub repo github. com/beefyfinance/beefy-audits. All major and critical issues have been resolved before code deployment of the relevant code. Beefy has never been hacked.


SECTION 5: Data and Reporting


Provide details on how your team is equipped to provide data and reporting on grant distribution.


Beefy’s contributor team collectively offers a range of skills and experience for monitoring and reporting on performance with grant funding.


On the technical side, our backend data infrastructure - Data Barn - collects, holds and analyzes a wide range of on-chain information about the Beefy protocol. For liquidity incentives of the kind contemplated by this proposal, we closely monitor protocol activity before, during and after a programme is deployed, to evaluate its effectiveness, the nature of the population interacting with the programme and the behaviors of participants. We use this data internally to refine and hone our approach to future programmes, and externally to inform partners and funders of the impact of our efforts.


Alongside this, our business development and finance teams closely track uses of grant funding against our agreed plans and targets, as well as carefully planning future uses to optimize for effectiveness. By targeting programmes around key time periods and events, and focussing on specific areas and narratives, we aim to effectively capture and disseminate information about our grant funding both publicly to users and the community, and internally or to our partners and funders. Details of all grant funding and spending are captured by our accounting systems and processes, and recorded in our quarterly financial reports 
Beefy Quarterly Report June 2023.pdf | DocDroid
. to help maximize transparency and feedback.


Is your team prepared to create Dune Dashboards for your incentive program?:


Yes, we are aware that having reliable data is elemental for measuring success. That is why we developed in-house, privacy-preserving data tools to measure activity in our protocol. We are also keen to build a community accessible dashboard for people to follow determined KPIs.


Does your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread?


Yes


Does your team acknowledge that failure to comply with any of the above requests can result in the halting of the program’s funding stream?:
 Yes"

] of which c. 30% of its volume is on Arbitrum






Based on past 30-days data on Arbitrum, ZKasino is the top gambling app with $4m+ onchain volume and 260+ number of unique active wallets (UAW) interacting or performing a transaction with a dapp’s smart contracts over a period of time.










1814×984 129 KB






As ZKasino is expanding fast its product suite and the Quest protocol has gotten amazing traction, we think it gives a perfect opportunity to use this grant to drive sustainable growth for Arbitrum and ZKasino.






Despite Arbitrum being a key market for Zkasino, only 6% of the total ZKasino UAW is from the Arbitrum ecosystem.






With only 260 users on Arbitrum, ZKasino has only 0.2% of the total onchain gambling market with a size of 150k active users (source: DappRadar)






As such, we believe there is a tremendous opportunity to acquire some Polygon ZKasino users, with a total of 4,000+ users base, and from the 150k+ onchain gambling market






A 300k ARB grant will drive at least 5k+ ZKasino users. Onchain gambling users have some of the highest LTV per user and ZKasino will be their first entry to the Arbitrum ecosystem






Lastly, we will use some of the grants to help acquire users from Asia where ARB has yet to expand fully






Execution Strategy: [Describe the plan for executing including resources, products, use of funds, and risk management. This includes allocations for specific pools, eligible assets, products, etc.]

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size
:






Trading Rewards
 = 1.35M – 2.55M ARB total (450K – 850K ARB per 28-day epoch)






Fusion Pools
: Powered by Elixir Protocol (“Elixir”) Liquidity Incentives = Up to 450K ARB total (150K ARB per 28-day epoch)






Total = 1.8M – 3M ARB
 (600K – 1M ARB per epoch)






The higher end is achieved if:






Vertex averages in excess of 140M USD volume daily. (>2x current levels)






Elixir onboards > average 10M USD TVL.






Elixir currently has >5M in stablecoin liquidity demand for Vertex Fusion pools.






Naturally, this brings additional liquidity into the ecosystem.






About Elixir Protocol


As part of the Vertex proposal, the grant will help subsidize Elixir Liquidity Providers (“LPs”) (available on the Vertex front-end shortly) with a baseline level of $ARB APY that incentivize a core base of liquidity while increasing the volume of Vertex as an Arbitrum-native DEX that positively impacts broader Arbitrum chain at large.


Elixir’s protocol will be powering Vertex’s upcoming “Fusion Pools” product, allowing users to supply USDC collateral to build up the orderbooks of perpetual futures as well as spot pairs on the exchange. End-users will tap into the VRTX incentives offered by Vertex in our ongoing incentives to reward their liquidity.


Elixir is building the industry’s first decentralized, algorithmic market-making protocol. Through the Elixir Protocol, anyone will be able to passively supply liquidity to orderbook pairs on perp DEXes across the space, earning subsidized APYs from existing long-term liquidity incentive programs offered by exchanges like Vertex.


Elixir’s underlying infrastructure is decentralized and high-throughput. The off-chain protocol reaches consensus on every order placed on an exchange. The infrastructure is similar to Arbitrum’s security model, with the protocol’s fraud proofs posted on-chain after being validated by a network of (at the present moment) 15,000 testnet v2 validators. All contracts are audited by Trail of Bits, with the Vertex integration going live in the coming weeks.


Elixir has roughly $5M in institutional capital lined up as a core base of liquidity for Vertex pairs, not including the retail liquidity from farmers and users that this will unlock. On launch, they will also make it as easy as possible for users to bridge capital from any chain into the Elixir contracts on Arbitrum via a native Stargate integration.

Grant Matching
:


Vertex currently runs a generous 
rewards program
. The program will continue alongside the incentives program proposed below giving dual incentives for trading to users, with approximately 10M VRTX tokens being allocated to each epoch.




Grant Breakdown
:


The grant will target increased volume and liquidity via Vertex’s highly performant orderbook architecture.


The grant will be used for three primary purposes:






Incentivize Community-Based Market-Making (Elixir)
:






Vertex and Elixir have been partners for several months, and are poised to finalize the integration of Elixir’s Fusion Pools on Vertex’s front end, which allows retail users to LP orderbook pairs on Vertex and accumulate $VRTX Trading Rewards.






Incentivizing Arbitrum DeFi users deploying liquidity into the Elixir fusion pools on Vertex with a baseline APR of 15% in $ARB on their assets.










Trading Rewards
:






Rewards on trading fees up to a maximum of 75% of the taker fee paid. The balance will be split proportionately if:






75% * Total Trading Fees > Allocated Grant Available










Sequencer Fee Removal
:




Should this proposal pass, Vertex is committed to removing sequencer fees on all trading pairs for the 3 months during which the incentives would be in effect. For a summary of Vertex’s sequencer fees, you can find them in the Vertex documentation 
here
.








Trading fees and liquidity incentives evince a significant impact on the demand for trading on any given exchange venue. Vertex already offers class-leading fees: the grant’s motivation is to increase liquidity and trading volumes by introducing more users to the Arbitrum ecosystem via incentivizing liquidity and broader participation in the ecosystem.


The proposed grant would unlock a compelling trading incentive structure without sequencer fees – bringing more capital to Arbitrum to trade. Additionally, the proposal would empower Vertex to maximize the transaction activity of on-chain traders.


Paired with a performant orderbook and broad product offering, trading rewards will accelerate Vertex and Arbitrum’s growth trajectory, stimulating trading demand and onboarding new users into the Arbitrum ecosystem.


The grant for each epoch will be equal to the total of:






Trading Rewards = Min [USD Volume * Trading fees * 75%, 850K ARB per epoch]






Elixir Incentives = Min [15% * TVL * ⅓, 150k]






Total = 600K - 1M ARB per epoch


If the total Taker Fees over 3 epochs (roughly three months) do not amount to a sum greater than 3M ARB, the remaining balance will be returned to the DAO.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives
:


The ultimate goal is to position Vertex as a premier order book DEX that can overtake dYdX as the leader in the DEX space within DeFi – attracting more liquidity and users to Arbitrum. Primarily, achieving a positive outcome means surpassing dYdX in both:






Trading Volume






User Base






Accomplishing the intended objective will elevate Vertex and Arbitrum, and infuse the Arbitrum ecosystem with increased liquidity and interest from traders – one of the largest user demographics within DeFi. Under extended bearish market conditions, pursuing a strategy that captures more traders and creates a moat around that inflow of new users is a compelling long-term tactic for the Arbitrum DAO.


A potential surge in trading activity and users can be harnessed by other projects in the Arbitrum ecosystem. For example, more organic, on-chain trading demand native to the network fosters a ripple effect across other Arbitrum projects where Vertex can serve as a liquidity hub for low-cost, performant trading.


Newcomers to the Arbitrum ecosystem seeking more cost-effective on-chain trading can use Vertex as a starting point to explore everything Arbitrum has to offer.




Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
:


KPIs for success:


Elixir LP Program


G
iven the focus on TVL for this part of the program, 150K ARB is to be allocated every month for three months, with yield capped at 15% for LPs.






If TVL > 10M USD, all ARB will be distributed.






If the average TVL over that period is < 10M USD, then a pro-rata amount will be distributed, with the balance sent back to the DAO.






Note: Depending on the market price of ARB tokens and average TVL over the grant period.


Trading Rewards Program


The key KPI for the trading rewards program will be trading volumes. As set out in the grant size justification below, it is envisaged that the grant will only be fully utilized if average daily volumes are in excess of 
140M USD daily
 (depending on ARB token prices during the course of the program).


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
:






Bring TVL to Arbitrum:






Traders seeking to benefit from Vertex’s market-leading fees and proposed liquidity incentives during this period will need to deposit assets for trading on Arbitrum. The proposed incentive structure, combined with Vertex’s unified margin engine and hybrid design, provides a more compelling case for both retail and sophisticated traders to become Arbitrum-native users.






Liquidity Providers (LPs) market-making via Vertex’s partnership with Elixir Protocol will also need to deploy capital into the Arbitrum ecosystem.










Grow Liquidity
:






The activity growth encouraged by incentives will also encourage more market-making activity. The benefits to market-making amplify as increased volumes boost market-maker profitability – capturing more institutional capital on Arbitrum.






This on-chain liquidity can be deployed to further other activity within the Arbitrum ecosystem, including yield strategies, arbitrage, and price discovery – all of which benefit other protocols besides Vertex.






The addition of Elixir Protocol will help distribute this activity to community members who can become a part of the core liquidity on Vertex.










Generate Sequencer Revenue
:






Increased on-chain activity generates more revenue for the Arbitrum DAO via gas fees. Essentially, a portion of this grant converts ARB tokens into ETH sequencer fees, helping to diversify the DAO Treasury’s revenue source.






Diversifying treasury revenue sources is a highly relevant topic for the Arbitrum DAO at large, and has often been an area where many DAOs have struggled in the past – 
typically, maintaining a significant majority of their capital base in the native token
. It’s an area where Arbitrum can choose to be more judicious and help promote activities that further this aim.












Justification for the size of the grant:


Liquidity incentives can potentially push Vertex volumes into the top spot for DEXs across ecosystems, unseating dYdX as the market leader – and benefitting the broader Arbitrum ecosystem. In the longer term, it would help Vertex evaluate the effect of lower fees for capturing more trading activity to the benefit of users and partners.


Trading Incentives


As incentives are disbursed there are two main outcomes:






<~140M USD Daily Volume
:




Vertex fails to grow more than 2x from current levels.


Incentives are capped by 75% of trading fees provision.


Full grant request is not needed, estimated cost < 3M ARB.


Vertex gets scaling data on the effects of trading rewards to help direct business models in the future.


Arbitrum gets data on the cost-effectiveness of incentives to Vertex.








> ~140M Daily Volume
:




Scale is achieved Vertex more than 2X.


Vertex grows into a high-volume market leader that absorbs more organic on-chain trading demand for Arbitrum.


Costs cap out at 2.55M total ARB, incentives distributed pro-rata vs. trading fees spent.








*
NB – We use 140M as a reference point as we can think of it as the point where the incentives reach targeted effect by more than doubling Vertex’s trading activity.




140M = (EpochGrant Size*Price_ARB)/(Vertex_FeeCapture/28DaysinEpoch)




Where:




ARB price = 0.8285 USDC and Vertex Fee Capture = 0.0175%




Elixir Incentives


In both cases, the absorption of new LP TVL into Vertex via Elixir should prove sticky and help provide backup liquidity to the existing market maker flow that exists on the platform, and cost no more than 
450K ARB
.


Execution Strategy
:






The grant will be held in a ⅗ multi-sig.






ARB tokens will be disbursed using tooling already built for Vertex’s internal token program.






Elixir’s Fusion Pool incentives will be paid by the Vertex team using Elixir as agent.






Grant Timeline
:


Once the grant is confirmed:






Establish three separate, four-week epochs (12 weeks total) commencing immediately upon the proposal’s passing.






Publicize the incentives to garner interest and on-chain trading demand.






Prepare a report on the grant results, which can be built quickly but will need at least four weeks of data to properly demonstrate efficacy.






Once the 3 months conclude, and if grants are not utilized, the remaining ARB tokens will be returned to the DAO treasury.






Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?


Yes

User Metrics
:


Since launch, Vertex has onboarded approximately 6,000 unique users, with 150 - 550 users transacting on the platform on a daily basis. They have shown strong retention rates, and the average visit duration of roughly 11 minutes on the Vertex app is significantly above average for DeFi applications. The visit duration on the app exists in spite of geofencing the US market, where US-based web traffic closely mirrors the high bounce rate (~40%) for the Vertex app domain.

Liquidity
:


Vertex’s order book provides over $1M of executable liquidity on BTC and ETH perps within 0.10% of mid-price at exceptionally low fee levels. Vertex’s integration with Elixir will further deepen liquidity and improve execution for trading.



Market depth is echoed on ALT pairs with liquidity in the range of $100K-500K within 0.20% of mid-prices.


Coupled with low fees, actionable trading depth on Vertex is unparalleled by other DEXs, which remain constrained by the TVL inefficiencies of AMM and pool-based models where liquidity is limited in some combination of depth, fees or scaling. Conventional x*y=k are incredibly inefficient, and at some point, pool-based derivatives DEXs are always at risk of exhausting their liquidity.


Gas Consumption
:


Vertex consistently ranks amongst the 
top gas-consuming applications on Arbitrum
.


The core Vertex contracts regularly consume 0.5% - 2.5% of the total gas fee market on Arbitrum.

Protocol Roadmap
:


The Vertex team has committed to community direction for roadmap planning as the protocol build is based on a responsive and agile philosophy that can adapt to the dynamism characteristic of DeFi. That being said, Vertex has pushed out numerous features since launch, including:






One-Click Trading
: Allows users to sign one transaction from and begin trading without further wallet signing – offering users a simplified trading UX on par with CEXs.






Pools Page
: Vertex’s integrated AMM enables LPs as margin and conventional x*y=k asset pools where liquidity from the AMM is injected into the orderbook.






Referrals
: Anyone can generate a referral code and earn boosted trading rewards from their referrals.






Portfolio Page
: More granular charts for user accounts on Vertex displaying portfolio stats like value, PnL, Balances, and Perp Trading.






Trading Pins
: Users can always monitor their accounts with customizable pins within the Vertex UI to tailor their trading experience to their preferences.






New Markets
: 23 markets have been added to Vertex since launch, including 19 perps and 4 spot markets.






Likely priorities for the next 12 months include:






Cross-chain integrations
 to help bring more users to Arbitrum.






Isolated Margin Accounts
 to simplify Vertex for retail users. Vertex utilizes 
unified cross-margin
 by default across spot, perps, and its embedded money market to maximize capital efficiency. Isolated margin would enable standard isolated margin perps as well, which are a popular request by users.






A mobile trading app
 to further expand Vertex’s appeal for different types of users. For example, the goal is to appeal to demographics like Robinhood traders in traditional equity markets who are interested in crypto trading and who primarily trade from the Robinhood mobile app.






Smart contract accounts
 to simplify and abstract away challenges with wallet UX.






Audit History
:


Vertex maintains an ongoing relationship with the well-reputed auditing firm, OtterSec. OtterSec completed a full audit of the Vertex contracts prior to the mainnet launch, and continually provides auditing services and feedback on the Vertex codebase.

SECTION 5: Data and Reporting


Provide details on how your team is equipped to provide data and reporting on grant distribution.


Is your team prepared to create Dune Dashboards for your incentive program?:


Yes. Vertex is integrated with Dune Analytics via dashboards created by third parties and the team also maintains internal reporting tools.






Dune Analytics
: 
https://dune.com/frijoles/vertex?undefined=






Vertex Stats Dashboard
: 
https://stats.vertexprotocol.com/






Does your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread?


The proposed reporting would be based on constructing a suitable Dune Analytics dashboard specific to the outcome of the proposal’s incentives.


The dashboard would primarily capture the metrics expressed below as a rate of growth compared to the growth rate before incentives to illustrate a clearer picture of the incentives’ overall impact. This approach allows for isolating changes directly attributable to the incentive program, where a comparison of the post-incentive growth rates to the pre-incentive rate can be more accurately evaluated.


Comparison of the following growth metrics on a relative basis before and after the proposed incentives include:






Trading Volume
: Measure the percentage change in trading volume, comparing it to the pre-incentive period.






Protocol Revenue
: Calculate the percentage increase in trading fee revenue relative to the pre-incentive period.






New User & Retention Rate Comparison
: Measure the percentage growth in the number of new users and active users compared to the pre-incentive phase – along with any changes in the user retention rate. This data can be supplemented with publicly available web traffic tools and analytics.






TVL Growth
: Measure the growth of TVL during the incentives period.






Cost Analysis
: Sequencer fees & market maker rebates changes.






More specific to the broader impact on the Arbitrum DAO, analyses composed of the following will also be applied to the dashboard:






ARB token impact
: Report on how many tokens are distributed and to how many wallets






Gas Consumption Rate
: Measuring any statistically significant variance in on-chain gas consumption of the Vertex contracts relative to current and historical data.






These metrics will help draw conclusions on the impact of token grants and how they can influence future thinking on Vertex’s fee model. They will also provide actionable data on how to optimize grants utilizing alternative incentive models in the future.


Does your team acknowledge that failure to comply with any of the above requests can result in the halting of the program’s funding stream?

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size:
 Siren Grant - 750,000 ARB


Grant Matching
: N/a (Perennial does not have a token)


Grant Breakdown:

Perennial will use this grant to help gradually bootstrap Perennial V2 markets. Grant allocation will be split between makers & takers — we’ll experiment with different mechanisms, and steer allocations towards those with the highest ROI for the Arbitrum ecosystem.


We’ll avoid naive forms of liquidity mining in favor of more precise mechanisms that act as a short-term jumpstart for fundamental usage. Jumpstarting Perennial V2 will significantly accelerate the development of a broader ecosystem built around on-chain perpetuals, enabling our community to onboard new interface partners, structured products, and launch new types of markets/derivatives.


Allocation of Funds:

Makers (50%)




Liquidity bootstrapping incentives for major pools (top traded perps)


Medium-term incentives for novel markets introduced (NFTs, RWAs, etc.)


Targeting incentives for power users (ex. Onboarding incentives)




Takers (50%)




Open-interest-based trading rewards & skew balancing incentives (also benefits makers)


Fee rebates & other onboarding incentives for high-value users




Funding Address:
 
0xcc2A6ef429b402f7d8D72D6AEcd6Dfd0D787AcfF


Funding Address Characteristics:
 Gnosis Safe with 2/3 signers


Contract Address:
 TBD — we haven’t deployed V2 contracts yet. We have an in-protocol reward system that allows Perennial to stream tokens to makers & takers with custom speeds (
See here
). Additionally, Perennial may build & open source additional contracts for distributing this grant.


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives:


Key Objective:

To position Perennial V2 & the Perennial ecosystem for sustainable long-term growth through the use of targeted incentives that accelerate fundamental adoption/usage.


Sub-Objectives:

Jumpstarting markets — New markets launched on Perennial require some amount of liquidity to operate efficiently. Without it, a healthy market may never develop (not enough liquidity for traders to enter + not enough traders for LPs to enter). Perennial can use short-term incentives to support the bootstrapping of a new market into a state of sustainable growth.


Reducing onboarding friction — Some of the highest value potential users of Perennial also have a high cost of time/attention (especially, the need to build out hedging infra or trade monitoring tools). This friction may prevent them from taking advantage of opportunities within Perennial that they otherwise would. Perennial can use targeted incentives to help this user group justify onboarding to Perennial (which will hopefully lead to longer-term retention after incentives end).


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


Fundamentally, Perennial is community-first and will live or die by the ecosystem around it. The core protocol is minimalistic, leaving the Arbitrum community to build out unique experiences & novel applications at higher layers of the stack. Our belief is that by creating an infrastructure-first derivatives primitive, we’ll help foster the development of a rich, composable DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum.


Arbitrum made a name for itself by pushing the envelope & becoming the epicenter for innovation in DeFi on L2. Perennial hopes to usher in a new era of this. Perennial’s V2 will enable the community to build products (apps, vaults, and protocols) that were too difficult or even impossible to build before, making it a driving force for innovation in the Arbitrum ecosystem. This includes things like hedged LP vaults, structured products, and new markets (NFT perps, squared perpetuals, RWA perps, etc.) — all will be built in & around a composable perp primitive. Perennial Labs aims to create the right tooling & resources to foster a community that continually is ahead of the curve to keep Arbitrum on top.


In our efforts to do so, Perennial is (and will continue to be) active in bringing new users, projects, and developers to Arbitrum. Perennial is being aggressive in its efforts to create novel markets, onboard new oracles/price feeds, frontends, and developers to Arbitrum — all of which bring new people/groups into the ecosystem. Perennial will be most successful when Arbitrum’s ecosystem as a whole is most successful, and we’re actively doing our part to help the right people/groups get involved.


Justification for the size of the grant:


Since launching on Arbiturm in February, Perennial has shown to be efficient in bootstrapping usage ($1.3B in volume) without incentives or an airdrop. 
Over the last 30 days Perennial has had $70m in volume
, and historically the protocol has had over 
$4mn TVL for nearly its entire time on Arbitrum
.


A grant of this size would bolster Perennial’s efforts to build a derivatives liquidity layer on Arbitrum. We aim to continue the momentum of V1 and build a protocol that’s top of mind for developers & users looking for novel products.


Execution Strategy:


Below we present an execution strategy to efficiently distribute protocol rewards with targeted incentives structured to maximize users retention.


Maker strategies (50%)




Bootstrapping major pools (top traded perps)
 — Incentives in core vaults/pools will be structured in seasons, with temporary boosts in liquidity aimed around new product/features releases (and/or new user onboarding) to maximize effectiveness/retention. These will target a market rate for liquidity & will be adjusted based on liquidity utilization.


Novel markets liquidity bootstrapping (NFTs, RWAs, etc.)
 — For innovative/novel markets, we’ll target a higher rate than core pools for a sustained period to help grow the market. These markets will have underdeveloped infra & userbases that incentives will help develop. We’ll carefully monitor usage & trader demand in these markets and adjust incentives accordingly (pulling them quickly if trader demand isn’t there).


Reduce Churn & Incentivise Deep Liquidity
 – In the interest of longevity, we’ll devise strategies to attract & reward makers who provide deep liquidity & scale up usage over an extended period of time. Having a strong foundation of long-term-aligned makers will ensure Perennial’s users have confidence that it will have consistent liquidity when they consider placing their next trade.




Takers strategies (50%)






Fee rebates / onboarding incentives for high-value users
 — This includes both broad & targeted strategies to reduce the costs associated with getting on boarded to Perennial (but without creating incentives to wash trade). On a broad basis, we define certain criteria that a user must meet to take advantage of short-term incentives in the form of fee rebates when first using Perennial to target those most likely to stick around after the rebates are gone. We may also tie some incentives to trying out new markets or by performing some desired behavior.






OI-based taker incentives & skew farming
 — This method incentivises consistent / long-term usage, and is perhaps the least gameable way to incentivize users in perpetual markets. Additionally, it has the nice property of actually helping balance long & shorts (when not longs/short are not equal, rewards will be skewed too). When skew is low, makers see benefit — the protocol’s liquidity requirement is significantly reduced (
see here
), makers take on less risk, and LPs can more comfortably use leverage, which will quickly allow Perennial to offer users deep liquidity with relatively little TVL.






Grant Timeline:

Once approved, we’ll begin prepping for issuing rewards. This could take a number of weeks, if contracts need to be audited. Thankfully, Perennial has a reward distribution mechanism built into the core protocol that is tested & audited, so this should help reduce the time to distribution.


Once the rewards are live, we’ll start off slow with allocations and gradually ramp up once we’re confident we’ve got the right strategies & parameterization of the reward program. We’ll begin & pause to evaluate strategies on some regular cadence (say every 2 weeks), updating the community along the way.


Additionally, we’ll try to correlate rewards with major milestones to amplify their effectiveness — Perennial will do it’s part to provide strong enough fundamentals to kickstart the flywheel, allowing the rewards to act as amplification of fundamentals. This includes things like temporary reward boosts following new market/feature releases, significant protocol upgrades (V2.1 released), and potentially meaningful ecosystem/partnership announcements.


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?:
 Yes


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:


Perennial V1
 launched on Ethereum mainnet; however costs and execution time made us look for other options. 2 months later, Perennial deployed to Arbitrum. Arbitrum has been our core focus (and the vast majority of usage) since.


Perennial V2
 is native to arbitrum.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?:


Perennial V1
 is on Arbitrum & Ethereum mainnet, but will be sunset.


Perennial V2
 will be native to Arbitrum (our core instance of the protocol), set to launch there in a matter of days. We also plan to deploy a subset of markets to Base sometime after launch.


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?:
 21st February, 2023


Protocol Performance:

Perennial performed quite well in its early days on Arbitrum: $1bn in volume, ~$10mn in notional liquidity, and 9,600+ unique traders in the first 3 months on Arbitrum. We proved the fundamental concepts behind Perennial as an on-chain primitive and went back to the drawing board (building Perennial V2) to improve the fundamental infrastructure upon which Perennial is built to allow it to scale.


Our Recap post covers some milestones we hit:

Greetings Arbitrum Community,


I am ilia.eth, CEO @ 0xPlasma Labs and the 
Plasma.Finance
 platform, a comprehensive DeFi infrastructure that encompasses a diverse range of DeFi tools designed for the Arbitrum chain. I am grateful for this chance to share my thoughts and suggestions for the enhancement of the Arbitrum ecosystem.


Objective:


The essence of this program lies in discovering innovative incentive strategies to bolster user engagement, volume, transactions, and liquidity within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Let’s commence with a brief insight into the present stage of Arbitrum’s ecosystem.


Risk Awareness:


The Arbitrum DAO’s intended distribution of 
50M ARB
 over three months stands as a substantial token influx. It is essential for DAO/delegates to coordinate this grant program seamlessly with the currently active incentive campaigns on the Arbitrum chain from various protocols and airdropped ARB tokens. For instance, Uniswap is presently conducting incentive campaigns for its pools.


Additionally, considering the existing on-chain DEX liquidity supporting the ARB price, a 50M ARB distribution in three months could potentially exert tremendous sell pressure, potentially plummeting the asset price in a continued bear market scenario.


Current Scenario:


With an aggregate ARB “Buy-side” TVL in all pools less than $10M, introducing nearly $50M of ARB sans buying pressure or liquidity support could drastically lower the price to around $0.2.


image
988×858 61.4 KB


Market Share:


Arbitrum commands a market share exceeding 50% in terms of TVL. A pivotal question here is the choice between incentivizing TVL or exploring alternative methods to stimulate liquidity retention.


image
2262×670 91.4 KB


Personal Insight:


In my opinion, the current significant TVL in Arbitrum does not necessitate further incentivization to attract more from the mainnet or other platforms. An exception might be the 
TVL of new vital assets for the chain, such as staked ETH (LSDs)
, where fund allocation by Arbitrum DAO would be beneficial.


The DeFi Landscape:


Arbitrum boasts a mature DeFi ecosystem, housing major players across diverse DeFi market segments. It is imperative to ensure the allocation of incentives to effective and efficient protocols and asset pools, avoiding capital wastage and market inefficiency enhancement.


image
2152×1526 489 KB


Proposed Strategies for Positive Ecosystem Impact:




Construct ARB DEX liquidity
: Shield it from a potential price dump from the Grant Program by compensating LPs to provide “buy-side liquidity” for ARB pools.


Encourage “Freezing” Liquidity
: Protect Arbitrum from the varying incentive campaigns on other L2 chains.


Incentivize Traders
: Offer gas refunds on trades, benefiting not only LPs but traders as well.


Implement Marketing Campaigns
: Collaborate with native protocols to stimulate on-chain user activities.


Retain
 the Majority of the Grant’s ARB within the Network: Ensure the majority is circulated back into the network rather than the order book.




Неre is my proposal which brings these conclusions together:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): [Specify the KPIs that will be used to measure success in achieving the grant objectives]


Our main KPIs for this Grant Campaign
: Vault Liquidity Growth (TVL), Vault Performance (% APY) and User Onboarding and Acquisition (LPs and Traders). These metrics will be significantly expanded when preparing a ARB dashboard for Quadrat.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?: [Provide details]


Quadrat, in its early development stages, stands at a pivotal juncture where the reception of this grant will substantially fuel its adoption and momentum within the Arbitrum chain. Our protocol brings to the table a suite of pioneering features including, but not limited to, staking, liquidity lockup, and farming tools. These elements are crafted to aid any native protocol in seamlessly amplifying its on-chain liquidity and capital efficiency, fostering a robust DeFi environment on the Arbitrum chain. The infusion of grant support will undeniably act as a catalyst, propelling both Quadrat and the Arbitrum ecosystem towards sustained growth and innovation.


Justification for the size of the grant: [Enter explanation]


The grant amount we seek is meticulously calculated, grounded in the potential to harness it for maximizing the impact on both growth and retention of liquidity within Arbitrum. Given that the Quadrat protocol predominantly relies on Uniswap liquidity, the ability to utilize any acquired funding is constrained solely by the comprehensive capacity of the Uniswap DEX, ensuring efficient and targeted use of the grant for substantial growth and stability.


Requested Grant Size:

1,000,000 ARB


Execution Strategy: [Describe the plan for executing including resources, products, use of funds, and risk management. This includes allocations for specific pools, eligible assets, products, etc.]


Upon the fortunate receipt of the ARB grant, the allocation will be systematically segmented for various types of incentive campaigns to ensure the most efficient and impactful utilization.


For Liquidity Farming:


The funds will be channeled towards the deployment of vaults for strategic liquidity pools on Uniswap v3. Our selection of pools for incentives will be meticulously aligned with the current Uniswap farming campaign to ensure seamless integration and avoidance of overlap. A significant number of the chosen pools will prominently feature ARB on one side, fostering enhanced liquidity provision and buy pressure for the ARB token. 
Prominent candidates include blue-chip assets and LSD.
 Subject to the grant approval, the Quadrat team stands committed to presenting exhaustive research on the Arbitrum liquidity market, including selected pools for liquidity lockup and incentives. A defining advantage of the Quadrat protocol lies in its capacity to encourage the lockup of liquidity funds, thereby substantially boosting liquidity retention.


For Gas Refund:


A dedicated contract will be established, enabling users to claim ARB tokens in relation to gas expenditures in HyperDEX routing throughout the three-month campaign. To safeguard against potential Sybil attacks, a stringent limit per account will be enforced alongside the blacklisting of bots.


For Buy-Side Protection for ARB Pool:


A vault will be inaugurated, positioned within the ETH/ARB pool, 
alongside incentives for ETH liquidity lockup spanning 3 to 6 months
, corresponding with the entire grant program duration. This strategy aims to solidify sufficient liquidity within the pool to shield ARB from any prospective price depreciation. With a total incentive allocation of 200K ARB, the objective is to attract and lock up $2M of liquidity on the buy side, ensuring robust protection against potential sell pressure.


For Marketing and Outreach:


Commencing immediately, diverse marketing campaigns will be launched, featuring quests to spur user activities and enhance educational outreach. Bi-weekly reports will be disseminated, offering transparent insights into the ongoing campaigns and metrics related to new user acquisition for the Arbitrum chain.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives:


As our name “iZUMi” in Japanese signifies, our ultimate goal is to help every partner and token to enjoy on-chain liquidity like spring water, continuous and long-lasting for centuries. Further, we hope to combine the DL-AMM algorithm with the ARB grant to flourish the Arbitrum ecosystem in every way.


1600×747 191 KB


Primary Objectives:






Introducing iZiSwap

We aim to introduce iZiSwap into the Arbitrum ecosystem, thereby expanding the available decentralized financial services on the network. Our unique DL-AMM model and on-chain order book function will serve as a robust liquidity and trading platform within Arbitrum. These objectives align closely with the goals of improving scalability, liquidity, and overall user experience within the Arbitrum environment.






To Enhance Liquidity and attract TVL on Arbitrum

The grant aims to improve the trading experience by reducing slippage and ensuring seamless transactions for top-tier projects on the Arbitrum network. The provision of liquidity is an essential aspect of this objective.








By allocating 40% of the grant towards providing one-sided liquidity to head projects, we expect to deepen the pool and minimize slippage, thus enhancing the trading experience. Half of which will be used for mining incentives.


In addition to fostering native projects, iZUMi team will actively seek to onboard leading projects from other ecosystems to the Arbitrum chain. Specifically, Izumi will extend invitations to partners from other blockchains with 1 million+ TVL to build and liquidity deployment on the Arbitrum network.






To Incentivize Liquidity Providers

A significant portion of the grant will be dedicated to rewarding LPs who actively contribute to liquidity pools. The intention is to foster a reliable and robust liquidity framework, making the platform attractive for both traders and projects.






The allocation of 30% of the grant for LP rewards aims to build a strong community of liquidity providers who are committed to the long-term success of the platform.






To Stimulate Trading Activity on Arbitrum

Encouraging a high trading volume is essential for any trading platform, and the grant aims to incentivize this via $ARB token rewards for active traders.






Allocating another 30% for trading incentives should stimulate trading activity, attract new traders, and maintain high user engagement.




Overall, the judicious use of the grant should lead to a more vibrant and sustainable ecosystem, enhancing the Arbitrum network’s appeal to various stakeholders including traders, project developers, and liquidity providers.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):




Total Value Locked：

TVL of different pools show liquidity depth: Measure the amount of assets locked in liquidity pools for top-tier projects, aiming to see a consistent increase. Specifically:






TVL of existing trading pools before incentives


TVL of new trading pools involving existing projects after $ARB grants






Total Number of LPs: serves as a growth indicator to track the participation level of liquidity providers, ensuring that our stakeholders can monitor the inflow of liquidity into the ecosystem.






All records of added liquidity by liquidity providers will be publicly disclosed.






Trading Volume: Monitor the total count and volume of successful on-chain swaps. Daily, weekly, and monthly trading volume in USD.






Daily trading volume


Daily trading fees generated






Active Users/ Token Pairs: Number of unique traders and token pairs engaging with the platform daily, weekly, or monthly.






Cumulative number of unique wallets


Cumulative number of token pairs on iZiSwap






Community Engagement: Track metrics like active forum participation, webinar attendance, etc.






Discord numbers


Telegram numbers


Reach and engagement levels on Twitter




Each KPI will be tracked at regular intervals, such as weekly, monthly, or quarterly, and will be compared against baselines and benchmarks. This comprehensive set of KPIs will provide a multi-faceted view of how successfully the grant’s objectives are being achieved.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?


Having a cutting-edge DEX is important for the Arbitrum ecosystem and for users. iZiSwap combined concentrated liquidity and order book DEX for wider user-adoption.


1496×502 49.5 KB


The DL-AMM algorithm uses a new discrete concentrated liquidity algorithm with concentrated liquidity market-making characteristics similar to Uniswap V3, but enables liquidity to be precisely distributed on any fixed prices rather than a price range. This allows iZiSwap to be more manageable in terms of liquidity and to support more trading methods, such as limit order. Limit orders will be considered as adding liquidity on one certain price tick so that you could trade with the fixed price rate as limit orders.


Securing a grant from the Arbitrum ecosystem would be pivotal for iZUMi Finance, serving as a cornerstone to expedite and scale our initiatives centered around liquidity and financial innovation. The grant would empower us to pursue several key objectives:






Enhanced Liquidity Solutions: With the aid of the grant, we plan to extend our LiquidBox solution to more projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem. This programmable Liquidity as a Service can make liquidity management more efficient, resulting in a smoother trading experience for traders, favorable rewards for LPs, higher TVL and income cash flows for Arbitrum and our project .






Expand iZiSwap’s Features: We intend to bring our DL-AMM model to Arbitrum. This will offer DEX users a CEX-like trading experience, allowing for limit orders in a non-custodial manner, which is a level of service often missing in most DEXs.






Launch of iUSD and iZUMi Bond on Arbitrum: Our fixed income products, iUSD and iZUMi Bond, have demonstrated strong utility. Bringing these to Arbitrum can create a more diversified financial ecosystem by adding stable, high-yield investment opportunities.






Optimizing Yield Mechanics: The grant will serve as a strategic enabler for refining yield mechanics on our platform. This optimization aims not only to benefit existing projects but also to incentivize new projects that are in the decision-making phase for selecting an ideal blockchain network.






Through these diversified yet interrelated initiatives, from enhancing liquidity solutions to optimizing yield mechanics, iZUMi Finance aims to act as a growth catalyst within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The grant will play a vital role in accomplishing these objectives, making Arbitrum an increasingly attractive landscape for decentralized financial innovation.


Justification for the size of the grant:


Deployed on multi-chains, including zkSync Era, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, and Ethereum, iZUMi has provided liquidity service 20+ renowned Web3 protocols, and managed over $100M liquidity from reputable institutions and 9,000 individual LPs.






Track Record and Team Expertise

Our team comprises 20 professionals who have been actively involved in the crypto space for over 5 years, and we’ve been deeply engaged in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector since its boom in the summer. Our experience and industry know-how position us well for executing complex projects.






Innovative Solutions

Our biggest feature makes us uniquely capable of bringing innovation and robust liquidity solutions to the Arbitrum ecosystem.

AMM (Automated Market Maker) is widely adopted for nearly all the DEXs for the sole reason of decentralization and permissonlessness, whilst all of them provide AMM in a continuous way, which means liquidity is spread across a continuous price range (function x*y=k).

DL-AMM of iZUMi cuts price ranges evenly into small narrow pieces (by ratio), making these price ranges as close as to 0. DL-AMM further enhances capital efficiency by making liquidity at every price range be needed. Through DL-AMM, users can trade tokens at an exact price to avoid front-run and slippage. Liquidity providers can enjoy more LP fees and high APR with maximized capital efficiency. We’re still unique in mechanics and more advanced than Uniswap V3 in terms of capital efficiency.






Proven Success

We have been in stable operation for over two years, first or second place on some chains like Mantle, zkSync, achieving liquidity in the tens of millions of USD. Our historical 24h transactions exceed 9.6 million, with 5,925,444 unique addresses and a TVL of $107 million. These numbers are a testament to the trust and adoption we’ve garnered.






Financial Backing

Our fundraising rounds have successfully raised $55 million from reputable backers like Bybit, IOSG, Hashkey, FENBUSHI, MIRANA, and 
gate.io
, providing us with the financial leverage to undertake large-scale projects.






Strategic Partnerships

Our reputable partners like BitDAO, Dehorizon, Ankr, Woo, Zebec, and others provide us with the ecosystem support needed for collaborative and highly impactful projects.






Execution Strategy:


The collaborations will span from the point of receiving the grant until January 2024. Different cycles will target different sets of projects for collaboration. Our team of 30 seasoned professionals will be fully engaged in this initiative. Technical development, business development, and marketing units will be actively involved.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size
: 500,000 ARB (Initial: 125,000; Additional: 375,000 only upon reaching KPI milestones and proving its effectiveness on the Arbitrum ecosystem)




80% to the Vaults


20% to GMX/DSQ V2 Pool distributed as Camelot Nitro Pool




Grant Matching
: We will add the same amount on esDSQ in GMX/DSQ nitro pool (which allows 2 tokens as rewards)


Grant Breakdown
: The primary objective of this grant is to create a flywheel for the start of our vaults and increase liquidity to the GMX/DSQ trading pair on Camelot. The D2.finance vaults utilize the assets under management for trading across Arbitrum protocols, which have a direct correlation between AUM and fees generated for Arbitrum ecosystem protocols. Additionally, at the time of writing, we have ~400k USD of Pool liquidity in both Camelot V2 and V3.


https://app.camelot.exchange/protocols/dsquared


https://arbiscan.io/address/0xFAacD4E480Bcc7e2cd945540ECA18cF471E55702




Our quant-based trading will drive substantial notional value through GMX and Camelot, and also through other Arbitrum protocols; this is especially true for ARB++ strategy, thus increasing volume and fees for the underlying protocols and ecosystem.


Our Unique Position in the Ecosystem:


For clarity, our proposal stands out in a unique way. To our knowledge, no other Active Vaults protocols boast the number of integrations we offer, all of which have been audited. If we attain a significant Total Value Locked (TVL), the impact of the grant will be magnified due to the increased volumes and fees generated through our partner integrations.


Here’s a snapshot of our integrations:




GMX: (Swaps, Limit Orders, Leverage Positions, GLP)


Camelot: (Swap, LP)


Lyra: (Options, LP)


Rysk: (Options, LP)


Aave: Lending and borrowing


TraderJoe: Swaps, LP


1inch: Swaps, Limit Orders




By incentivizing liquidity in the vaults, we can drive more trading volume and, in turn, will increase the fees generated by our vaults, which will help us sustain our operations and continue to innovate.


Given that we particularly value our official partnerships with both GMX and Camelot we are looking to deploy 100% of the grant funds in a way that benefits them either directly into the GMX/DSQ pool or indirectly through trading of our Vaults.


In particular, we are very grateful to GMX for which we completed a token swap on December 10, 2022.

Vaults V1: This is the original design we were developing before the FTX blow-up, which prompted changes in both regulatory compliance and security standards. Vaults V1 are semi-custodial.


Vaults V2: The focus of the current Paladin audit, Vaults V2, operates under a fully modular architecture. It incorporates embedded risk management rules and can only be deployed from a tradeApp. Vaults V2 boast two layers of security: first at the Solidity level and then risk management limits at the OMS level (internal traderApp), akin to hedge fund practices that Luca is used to.


Vaults V3: Code name “Omni Vaults”, aims to meet institutional requirements and is under development utilizing Chainlink CCIP.


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives
: The primary objective of this grant is to create a flywheel for the start of our vaults and increase liquidity to GMX/DSQ. Our architecture utilizes, but not limited to:




AAVE, Camelot, GMX, Lyra, Rysk, TraderJoe and 1inch




Our quant-based trading will drive substantial notional value through Arbitrum protocols, thus increasing volume and fees for the underlying protocols and ecosystem. By incentivizing liquidity in the vaults, we can drive more trading volume and, in turn, will increase the fees generated by our vaults, which will help us sustain our operations and continue to innovate.


To demonstrate our commitment and belief in our project, we’re initially requesting a grant of only 125k (comprising 100k for vaults and an additional 25k for GMX/DSQ liquidity). This represents approximately 1/3 of the TVL. We wish to highlight that we will seek the further 375k only if the vaults, set to expire on 19th January, reach their maximum capacity (CAP). The maximum request will, in any scenario, not exceed the Cap.


Indeed, as our vaults go live, we project a surge in liquidity needs, especially once the market grasps the full breadth of our offering. This anticipation aligns with our strategy for the second version (v2) liquidity, as we predominantly envision utilizing v3 exclusively for POL.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
: We will measure the success of this grant using the following KPIs:




Total value locked (TVL) in our vaults growing steadily toward the 10M scalability goal


Number of users of our vaults with more than 10k USDC allocations


Fees generated by our vaults in relation to TVL and performance


Fees and Volumes generated for the underlying integrations


Number of partnerships with other Arbitrum DeFi projects




We expect significant growth in all these metrics due to this grant.


Tracking TVL growth is crucial, as it directly correlates with the protocol’s success. Higher TVL translates into increased fees and reflects growing user trust and confidence in our protocol. This will be beneficial not only for our protocol but also for our partner tokens like GMX and Camelot, as it will drive higher liquidity and trading volume for them.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
: Receiving this grant will enable us to foster growth within Arbitrum in 2 key areas:


Attracting liquidity into the actively managed trading vaults




greater volume in the trading vaults equates to more active trading volume/fees across the underlying protocols




By showing growth and proof of concept, ART, our sister protocol tailored at institutions, will have measurable back data to help onboard significant institutional funds into the Arbitrum ecosystem via the quant trading vaults.






artechnology.io






ARTechnology


Our ambition is to be the most successful investment firm in the digital assets space. We strive to identify the highest and best uses of capital to generate superior long-term returns












Justification for the size of the grant
: Our estimated capacity for the vault is approximately 10M USD.


A 4% boost ( ⅘ of the grant) to create a performance floor can go a long way, especially under these market conditions.


D2.finance / BWS Lab’s hybrid model leverages the specialist skills of a world-class team with a provable P&L from years of profitable trading in TradFi. Head of Trading, Luca, brings his unique investment philosophy, process, and approach to risk-managed volatility trading. Each vault at D2.finance combines tailored quantitative signals with the expertise of direct, real-time human judgment, all while leveraging the operational infrastructure and technical integrations made possible by DeFi protocols on Arbitrum.


By funding a grant for D2.finance, the funds will be put to active use within the Arbitrum ecosystem, driving a continuous flow of trading volume and fees across the ecosystem integration partners.


Beyond direct application, our vaults have an inherent advantage of indirectly bolstering Arbitrum’s appeal. Particularly with traditional finance entities that have remained on the sidelines, introducing a robust Hedge Funds offering catalyzes their interest in the crypto space and Arbitrum ecosystem. This inevitably magnifies the allure of exploring the ecosystem, leading to increased liquidity and activity on Arbitrum. Our strategy is designed not only for immediate benefits but to also serve as a magnet, drawing both conventional and emerging financial players into the fold. The greater the TVL D2.finance can capture, the bigger net benefit to the entire ecosystem through notional trading value.


V0 Notional performance:

With TVL driven by internal funds (v0 vaults ranged from 2000 to 20000 USDC) D2 vaults have been able to create already over 1 Million USD+ in notional volumes across the Arbitrum ecosystem (see EOA wallets above)


Example:




The first epoch of the ETH++ Vault generated 300k of volumes in GMX alone:


https://dune.com/queries/1924216/3173218




ETH++ Vault generated ≈3.6% fees of AUM in GMX in 1-2 months epoch, ≈20% if annualized.




As DSQ can be staked for claims on platform rewards, we expect the demand to grow with the TVL in the vaults and, as such, we aim to incentive a GMX/DSQ Camelot V2 LP pool to both meet the demand and benefit both Camelot and GMX.


Execution Strategy
:


Vault Incentives (4/5 of grant) will be distributed gradually based on the performance of the quant trading vaults, and distribution will be ramped up based on successful KPIs


DSQ/GMX V2 Liquidity Pair (1/5 of grant) will be distributed proportionally over a 3 month period to the Vault Incentives in order to accommodate the expected need for DSQ liquidity


A conservative estimate is that if our Vaults achieve 10M TVL / AUM we will generate north of 1M dollars of fees in the ecosystem annually.


Risk Management for the trading/vault products:

A sustained period of live trading experience is required to learn important risk management lessons. Theory alone is not enough. Our Systematic Dynamic Risk Management framework has been developed through many years of practical experience and academic research and has been battle-tested at the institutional level in TradFi.


Our core approach is to manage risk through efficient use of options and hedges dynamically optimized according to market conditions. By adding market hedges to the portfolio, we can take advantage of opportunities created by downside volatility and market crises, while still maintaining some upside potential.


Protocol Security:D2.finance has industry-leading security and risk management practices in place. 
Security - D2.Finance


Grant Timeline
: Funds will be used over November, December (up to 125,000 ARB) and January ( up to remaining 375,000 epochs), starting from the initial grant deposit.

We understand that the funds will be streamed linearly over the 3-month grant program duration.


This funding structure ensures that resources are allocated efficiently and in line with the protocol’s performance. It also incentivizes us to achieve sustained growth and success by linking the release of funds to specific, quantifiable milestones.

Protocol Roadmap
: Q4 2023 Live vaults


We’re delighted to inform that the audit of Paladin as 27th September 2023 is now completed.


Trading via the ARB++ and ETH++ vaults will commence on Friday 6TH October.


In the spirit of stress-testing our security, we will invite hackers to attempt to breach our system, and if successful, they will be rewarded with 100% of the hack, similar to the approach taken by Yearn Finance in the past.


https://twitter.com/yearnfi/status/1683892838826639374?s=46&t=KFQT0AoRGidqSKSrryeu8Q


Following this phase, we plan to incorporate both Luca’s and Medallion funds (Private Investor class). After one epoch, the Medallion allocations will be returned to their original addresses for those who may choose to reinvest once vaults are open (no action is required).


With a successful phased rollout of the vaults, we will accept funds into the vaults for active quant trading.


Note: For V3 Vaults we are looking to integrate other Arbitrum protocols such as Rysk, aevo, dopex, rodeo, and more alongside Chainlink CCIP, allowing liquidity from other chains to be seamlessly and securely utilized on Arbitrum

Curve is eager to begin allocating incentives toward a new strategy that will promote crvUSD migration to Arbitrum and will strengthen liquidity depth and trade volumes for both stablecoins and blue-chip crypto (BTC and ETH) on Arbitrum. The strategy involves the deployment of extremely low-fee stableswap pools paired with crvUSD (.01% swap fee) and a crvUSD-paired tricrypto pool (crvUSD/ETH/tBTC).


crvUSD is an overcollaterized stablecoin backed by a diverse set of collateral, including sfrxETH, wstETH, WBTC, WETH, and tBTC. The stablecoin was deployed in March 2023 and has reached a market cap of >$100m since inception. Its primary innovations are the LLAMMA AMM which gradually liquidates positions, and a dynamic monetary policy that adjusts interest rates based on market dynamics. Supporting the growth of crvUSD on Arbitrum will help Arbitrum become a hub for the adoption of decentralized stablecoins and enable the creation of new DeFi markets as deep crvUSD liquidity becomes available through Curve.


This grant will be used exclusively to incentivize liquidity in Arbitrum Curve pools. We intend to handle the distro with the following strategy:




Allocate 100k ARB per week for 16 weeks as liquidity incentives



20k ARB each to 3 stableswap pools paired with crvUSD (e.g. crvUSD/USDT, crvUSD/USDC, crvUSD/FRAX)


40k ARB to the tricrypto pool paired with crvUSD (e.g. crvUSD/ETH/tBTC)








Pending the availability of a vote incentives market, the ARB may be either deployed as vote incentives to veCRV voters that allocate CRV gauge emissions to the target pools or, in the absence of an acceptable vote market, the ARB will be deployed to the pool rewards as a direct LP incentive.


As we are submitting this proposal on behalf of Curve DAO, we request that the grant funds be sent to the 
Curve DAO-controlled Treasury on Arbitrum
. The custody of funds is entirely decentralized, governed by veCRV voters and on-chain votes initiated on Ethereum mainnet. There is a relayer that executes commands on Arbitrum, which you can see was tested successfully on May 4th with a transfer of 1 ARB out of the treasury address.


Once funds have been received, we will work with the Curve core team to deploy the grant. This will involve creating a contract to handle the distro logic and initiating an on-chain vote to approve the distro strategy as it has been outlined above.


Distribution will begin shortly after the necessary pools and distro contract have been deployed. On-chain votes take 7 days to execute, after which the incentives can begin. The program will allocate ARB every week until all ARB is distributed after 16 weeks.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives


Strengthening DeFi Bonds


Curve prides itself in its role as a liquidity hub for a multitude of protocols. Curve is not just a DEX; it is an extended network of DeFi protocols that have integrations and governance stakes in the protocol. Just about any DeFi protocol that issues a stablecoin, RWA, or LST has a significant presence on Curve as its core liquidity hub. This positions Curve as an essential component of a robust ecosystem that can withstand any and all market conditions.


Boosting Core Liquidity on Arbitrum


Curve’s stableswap AMM excels for pools involving like-kind assets. LPs are attracted to these pools as a way to earn real yield from swap fees while mitigating the risk of impermanent loss (as assets supplied to Curve pools are expected to be mean reverting). There is an expectation of increased stablecoin assets bridged to Arbitrum as LPs seek superior yield opportunities on Curve.


Streamlining Liquidity Costs for Ecosystem Projects


Deep liquidity is essential for the vitality and success of the overall DeFi ecosystem, particularly for applications like money markets, to facilitate protocol liquidations. We intend for this grant to contribute to readily accessible liquidity within the thriving Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem, encompassing major stablecoins and blue-chip crypto assets. By enhancing Curve pools on Arbitrum, we aim to reduce the liquidity cost for all projects on Arbitrum seeking a reliable liquidity solution.


Sustaining Incentives with CRV Emissions


A short-term incentive program runs the risk of seeing mass liquidity outflows after incentives end. Our goal is to jumpstart demand to Arbitrum that veCRV stakeholders will be motivated to continue allocating CRV emissions toward these pools even after the ARB incentives end. CRV’s emission schedule lasts hundreds of years, giving Curve the means to incentivize liquidity on Arbitrum for years to come.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):


To measure the success of this grant, we will use the following key performance indicators:




crvUSD migration: The total value of crvUSD that migrates to Arbitrum.


Curve pool TVL: The total value of Curve pool liquidity


Liquidity utilization: Both overall pool volume and liquidity utilization in the incentivized pools.




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?


Curve is the backbone of the burgeoning DeFi industry. It touches every piece of the stack and strengthens every integrated protocol. There is an opportunity for Arbitrum to leverage Curve’s foundational role to further support its vibrant ecosystem. Examples of how Curve spurs DeFi integration include:




The stableswap algorithm, well known for enabling deep liquidity and low slippage swaps, has built a reputation for stabilizing pegs and enhancing stablecoin utility.  (e.g. FRAX, 3CRV)


Curve has a number of integrations with lending markets, yield-bearing derivatives, and real-world assets. Swap fees compound the interest generated from these activities. (e.g. Aave, stETH, STBT)


Highly configurable V2 pools are unlocking new potential for FX markets and volatile crypto pairs. The concentrated liquidity algorithm offers advantages to LPs and traders, combining a composable AMM design with low-slippage swaps. (e.g. Tricrypto, eursusd)




Justification for the size of the grant:


Referencing the 
StakeDAO votemarket
, tricrypto pools are being incentivized with around $32k worth of tokens per week. crvUSD pools are being incentivized around $21k worth of tokens per week. This proposal is targeting a comparable value for the Arbitrum incentivized pools. Given an ARB price ~$0.82, the proposed weekly incentives amount to around $32,800/week to the Arbitrum tricrypto pool and $16,400/week to each crvUSD stableswap pool.


The incentives will result in a significant influx of crvUSD to Arbitrum, enabling new markets for other applications to integrate. The grant will pay dividends in terms of future potential integrations and does not contribute to any direct selling pressure of the ARB token.


Execution Strategy:


Our execution plan includes the following steps:




Pool Deployment: The stableswap-ng pool implementation will be used to deploy the stableswap pools. A crvUSD tricrypto pool will also be deployed


ARB Distro Handle Contract: A distribution contract will be deployed for the non-custodial distribution of the ARB tokens.


Incentive Campaign: Run incentives to the specified Cuve pools for 16 weeks




Grant Timeline:


The projected timeline is as follows:




Development: 3 weeks. This is for necessary pool and distro contract deployments. While a relatively simple undertaking, there is some uncertainty about when the stablecoin-ng implementation will be in production. It is currently undergoing an audit.


On-chain vote: 1 week. A vote to allocate ARB to the distro contract


Incentives: Incentives will run for 16 weeks.




SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Provide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:

Protocol Performance:


As per DefiLlama on September 25th, 2023:


TVL: $1.963B

Cumulative Revenue: $126.53M

Cumulative Admin Fees Paid to LPs: $126.53M

Cumulative Annual Volume: $90.977B (average $249M/day)


Past Performance:


A 
report
 by Delphi Digital released in July 2022 pulled data from every trade on the ETH/USDT pair on both Curve Tricrypto and Uniswap and simulated every trade on the opposite venue. It found that price quotes were better on Curve 65% of the time, although it only captured 35% of the volume. This was attributable to the higher gas cost of the more complex Curve pool.

1148×610 11.8 KB


When running the same test on Arbitrum, the “ideal” volume matched the actual volume much more closely, suggesting that Curve performs much better on a cheap gas platform like Arbitrum.


image
1148×610 11.8 KB


Not only does Curve have the capacity to offer superior trade execution on L2s like Arbitrum, it offers a superior experience for LPs. Curve uses an internal price oracle and dynamic fees, only updating the price scale if losses from re-pegging are made up for by at least half of the pool profits from fees. While the complex logic makes Curve V2 pools less competitive on mainnet, it is a truly automated market maker designed to protect LPs from erosion of their supplied value through impermanent loss.


Protocol Roadmap:


Curve is making strides with the adoption of crvUSD. New pool implementations (tagged -ng) have an EMA oracle used with the Curve LLAMMA algorithm. The roadmap includes plans to make use of Curve LP positions as markets for crvUSD, enabling leveraged liquidity. There are also plans for money markets around crvUSD. Pegkeepers currently support the stablecoin peg and improvements are being made to the PK algorithm.


Curve is also working to integrate RWAs such as offerings by Matrixdock, Ondo, and others that are tokenized t-bills and overnight reverse repos. These assets have unique challenges to comply with regulations and Curve is working with them to find compliant solutions that unlock reliable yield for DeFi.


Audit History:


Curve has been heavily audited. The crvUSD protocol underwent a comprehensive audit by 3 separate audit firms before launch. Every upgrade to the Curve protocol involves audits as part of standard security practice.


A list of Curve audit reports can be found 
here

GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives




Promote volume and activity on capital-efficient pools on Arbitrum


Improve liquidity for the initial market-making layer for perps


Give traders a financial incentive to utilize an intent-based swap meta-aggregator




Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?

UniDex is a protocol that empowers other protocols. The job of an aggregator is to connect users with an underutilized or more optimal path at that moment. There is no bias for an aggregator and how well a protocol can “do marketing” is irrelevant. All that matters is numbers and giving traders the best fill.


There are more Perp DEXs on Arbitrum than you can count with both hands, but most won’t catch traders attention even when they’re offering better rates than other platforms. At UniDex, we’re 
seasoned
 in aggregation, pioneering perp and spot aggregation since 2020. This grant is not merely a resource for us; it’s a catalyst for the entire ecosystem. It will unlock liquidity sources that might otherwise remain untapped and elevate the utilization of aggregators comprehensively.


We are confident in asserting that we stand out as the most qualified project to declare, “This grant serves to enhance and leverage the entire Arbitrum ecosystem.” The support from these incentives will enable users to access a diverse array of protocols, fostering growth and optimizing the potential of what Arbitrum has to offer.


Justification for the size of the grant


We ask for 750,000 ARB because of the positive impact we’ve had on the Arbitrum ecosystem since our deployment during the first few minutes Mainnet went live, and how well we would be able to foster growth to lesser-known protocols that have been integrated.


UniDex has been at the forefront, offering numerous public goods and high-quality services. We’ve provided subgraph hosting services for teams, freely available and public aggregated RPC endpoints, a deeply integrated swap protocol, and we stand as the first and most comprehensive perp aggregator. A substantial portion of the incentives directly promotes the use of other protocols through our aggregator, both for spot and perps. Therefore, we believe our request aligns perfectly with the values and objectives of the STIP program, aiming to bolster growth & usage of the entire ecosystem.


Execution Strategy


375,000 (50%) - Trades routed to native UniDex liquidity pools




Trades that are routed to UniDex LPs for perps will have a scoring system for how much is rebated back to the user.


Each trade will have 20% of the fee spent rebated back but this can be increased based on certain factors outlined below


We assume weekly numbers for referred volume and referring 10m in volume qualifies you for the lower 2 tiers bonus as well






262,500 (25%) - Perp trades routed to other Arbitrum perp DEXs via aggregation




Trades aggregated to other perp DEXs would follow a similar rebate structure






93,750 (12.5%) - Liquidity provider rewards




The goal here is to increase TVL, give more opportunity for collateral swaps, and increase utilization of commonly aggregated pools


Rewards are distributed automatically, and yield hopping is curbed through the user of minimum deposit times. This encourages longer term pooling and keeps activity healthy.


Any LP would be eligible for rewards based on the amount deposited.


We treat the USD deposit value / Total TVL for how much rewards you will be earning




93,750 (12.5%) - Positive slippage / Surplus matching for swaps




We will use 12.5% of the grant to match positive slippage earned from a swap


The positive slippage can occur from regular spot trades or collateral swaps during the perp aggregation process


This greatly encourages traders to use the batch auction meta-aggregator as there’s an incentive to use the meta-aggregator, while also increasing the chance for additional surplus due to the increased frequency of batched orders from CoW orders.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size:
 600,000 ARB


Grant Matching:


Yes, the lending vaults on Vaultka will be incentivized by esVKA token alongside the ARB tokens provided by this grant. A total of 42 million esVKA is allocated to incentive the vaults (2.1 million in the first 3 months), in order to attract more liquidity to the Perp DEX market.


Grant Breakdown:




20% Promoting Perp DEX Ecosystem Growth (120,000 ARB)






One of the key objectives outlined is to consolidate and advocate for the utilization of various Perpetual Decentralized Exchanges (Perp DEX) on the Arbitrum network.


A segment of the grant funds will be allocated to incentivize users to explore a diverse range of Perp DEX platforms, thereby nurturing a diverse ecosystem of Perp DEX and fostering healthy competition among them. Additionally, this initiative aims to amplify the visibility of smaller-scale Perp DEX platforms offering innovative solutions.


As part of this effort, users who provide liquidity on any five of the top 10 (According to Defillama, sort by TVL) Perp DEX platforms on Arbitrum will be rewarded with an equal distribution of ARB tokens. This serves as a form of encouragement to engage with a variety of Perp DEX liquidity pools, promoting a more vibrant and dynamic ecosystem.






80% Connecting Lending Capital to Perp DEX LP (480,000 ARB)






Another core principle of Vaultka is to establish a link between lending capital and the Perp DEX market, thereby optimizing capital efficiency across the entire Perp DEX landscape


Vaultka serves as the bridge between lenders and leveraged LP users, creating a mutually beneficial scenario: LP users can amplify their positions and maximize returns, while lenders can secure a higher yield compared to traditional lending platforms, without compromising on risk.


To showcase their commitment to providing liquidity to the Perp DEX ecosystem, ARB rewards will be distributed to lenders who lock their lending POD tokens within Vaultka


A longer lock-in period translates to a higher multiplier applied to the locked funds, resulting in a larger share of ARB rewards.


This initiative is designed to attract lending capital from traditional lending protocols, encouraging migration to and deposits in LP lending pools, thereby amplifying the influx of capital into the Perp DEX LP ecosystem.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives:


Vaultka’s aim is to unify Perp DEX protocols on Arbitrum, nurturing the robust growth of the entire Perp DEX ecosystem. This grant serves as a strategic avenue to advance our goal in two distinctive ways:




Encourage users to try out different Perp DEX on Arbitrum




Our primary objective is to stimulate active user engagement with various Perpetual Decentralized Exchange Liquidity Pools (Perp DEX LPs) on the Arbitrum network. We aim to achieve this by incentivizing users to explore and participate in a diverse range of Perp DEX LPs, thereby cultivating a culture of diversified participation.


Simultaneously, we seek to champion the long-tail Perp DEX ecosystem, nurturing a landscape where smaller-scale Perp DEX platforms offering innovative solutions can thrive. Our intention is to foster a healthy competitive environment among Perp DEX players, enabling these innovative solutions to garner the attention and recognition they deserve.


Our commitment extends beyond Vaultka alone; we aspire to contribute meaningfully to the holistic growth of the entire Arbitrum Perp DEX ecosystem. By encouraging users to venture beyond their comfort zones and explore various Perp DEX options, we hope to fortify and invigorate the broader ecosystem. This way, our efforts will have a lasting and positive impact on the entire Arbitrum Perp DEX landscape.




Connect Lending Capitals to Perp DEX and enhance overall liquidity efficiency




Another aim is to establish a seamless connection between lending capital and Perp DEX LPs on the Arbitrum network. We are dedicated to optimizing capital efficiency within this dynamic landscape.


Our strategy involves bridging lending capital with the vibrant Perp DEX market, all while preserving the inherently low-risk nature of lending. This mission underscores our commitment to maintaining financial security for lenders even as we channel their funds into the dynamic world of Perp DEX trading.


Through these efforts, we aspire to create a win-win scenario: lending funds will enrich the Perp DEX market, enhancing its capital efficiency, while lenders continue to enjoy the security and reliability they expect.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):


In line with our objectives, we will maintain a vigilant watch over the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?




20% for Promoting Perp DEX Ecosystem Growth (120,000 ARB)




This designated 20% of the grant will be utilized for experimental purposes, aiming to test innovative strategies that foster ecosystem growth. The ARB tokens will serve as an added economic incentive, motivating users to explore various Perp DEX LPs on the Arbitrum network. Users who contribute liquidity to at least five distinct Perp DEX platforms on Arbitrum will be duly rewarded for their active participation within the Perp DEX ecosystem. These rewards include LP incentives from the respective underlying protocols, alongside an additional ARB reward facilitated by Vaultka. This initiative not only encourages users to diversify their Perp DEX engagement but also fosters healthy competition among protocols.


Furthermore, this endeavor plays a pivotal role in nurturing the long-tail Perp DEX ecosystem on Arbitrum. Currently, GMX dominates the Perp DEX market, commanding roughly 70% of the Total Value Locked. Vaultka’s mission is to elevate the visibility and recognition of smaller-scale Perp DEX platforms offering innovative solutions. By doing so, we aim to stimulate healthy competition between protocols and promote a more diverse and dynamic ecosystem.


1067×733 43.7 KB




80% for Connecting Lending Capital to Perp DEX LPs




Lenders will be duly rewarded with ARB tokens upon locking their funds within Vaultka. These lending capital reserves will be actively utilized within leverage vaults, enabling the efficient deployment of lending funds into the Perp DEX ecosystem to bolster trading activities.


In traditional lending protocols, lending capitals are siloed and, existing separately from Perp DEX liquidity. This segregation results in capital inefficiency, largely attributed to the overcollateralized nature of these funds. Vaultka’s lending vaults bridge the gap, connecting lending capital directly to the Perp DEX liquidity pool. Crucially, this is accomplished without elevating the risk exposure of lenders. Furthermore, these lending vaults enable undercollateralized utilization on Perp DEX Liquidity Pools. This creates a win-win situation to both leverage users and lenders, and ultimately draws more liquidity to the Perp DEX market.


1600×870 161 KB


Justification for the size of the grant:


Why 120,000 ARB for growing the ecosystem?




Active Arbitrum User past 30 days: 2.67m


Total LP providers address is around 165,000, which is around 6.18% of the total Arbitrum DEfi users (Estimated by the number of holders of LP tokens from Arbiscan)


Assume that originally there is only 5% (rough estimate, based on the pie-chart above) of the Perp DEX LP users have tried out more than 5 Perp DEX, which is around 8250 users


Through this grant, we aim to increase 25% of the number of users, which is 2063 users that tried out more than 5 Perp DEX


If we want to achieve 25% APR ARB reward to these users, assuming ARB price is $0.9, minimum deposit is 500 (minimum each $100),




Estimated Claimable ARB for each user = 25%*500/12/0.9 = 11.57 ARB


Total need of ARB = 11.57
8250
1.25 = ~120,000ARB


Thus, a total of 120,000 ARB is reserved to boost the ecosystem


Why 480,000 ARB for attracting more lending capital?




The current lending TVL in Vaultka is around 2M


With this grant, we aim to double our lending TVL by attracting an additional 2M of deposits


With reference to the APR calculation in the Execution Strategy below, users can get up to 26% APR in ARB with a stablecoin deposit, which is a very attractive offer for lenders


The TVL created to ARB invested ratio will be

= 2,000,000 : 480,000*0.9




= 4.63:1


Thus, this grant is expected to create around 4.6 times of TVL in lending capital compare to that of ARB tokens invested.


Execution Strategy:


120,000ARB for using different Perp DEX on Arbitrum:


Details:






Every User will have an equal share of ARB. This is to maintain a fair chance for all users to try out different protocols, and their incentive will not be diluted by whales, which this also matches our thesis of attracting more new users to try out the Perp DEX ecosystem






Deposits in each protocol has to be >$100 in order to be count as a qualified deposit, to prevent malicious users gaming the system






Eligible Perp DEX: (Top 10 Protocols on DefiLlama under the Category “Derivatives” on Arbitrum). You may find the full list of whitelisted protocols 
here
. The current list is based on data as of 26/9/2023, the list will be updated again after the grant is distributed.






Formula:




User’s claimable ARB = 120000/Total Eligible Wallets








How to prevent people from creating multiple bot accounts to get more ARB rewards




Implement a minimum of $100 to each deposit in order to be qualified, so that even if they created lots of accounts, they need to deposit a huge amount of liquidity to Perp DEXs in order to get the majority of ARB rewards. Plus, the withdrawal fees of these LPs will be enough to costly for the malicious actors as well, which in turn will be beneficial to the underlying protocols


Double Check with the total increase of User in Arbitrum Defi to see if any abnormal increase


Examine and match the increase with the increase of Arbitrum Perp DEX user




Execution Plan:




Vaultka will take a snapshot on all the wallet addresses that have provided liquidity to any 5 of the whitelisted Perp DEX before the ending date


Whitelisted Perp DEX (Top 10 Perp DEX on Arbitrum according DefiLlama)


Eligible users can claim the ARB rewards on Vaultka page


Filter out the Perp DEX LP vault contracts and fetch the user data from deposit events to filter out which users have deposited in more than 5 Perp DEX


Unclaimed ARB after 3 month of end date will be refunded to Arbitrum DAO




480,000ARB for locking lending funds:




Lenders restake and lock their POD tokens (WATER tokens) in a dedicated smart contract. With a longer locking period, a larger multiplier is applied to the locked funds.


Locking period are fixed with 4 options

Users can claim their eligible amount of ARB after the 1 month locking window ends


There will be a 3 month claiming period for users to claim their ARB


Unclaimed ARB tokens will be refunded to Arbitrum DAO along with part 1’s ARB

Protocol Roadmap:


Vaultka remains devoted in its commitment to fostering the expansion of Perp DEX ecosystems on Arbitrum. We have extensive strategies in place to roll out a range of products aimed at bolstering the Perp DEX environment and enriching the overall user experience. Vaultka is also set to collaborate with various protocols to deliver innovative solutions tailored to diverse user needs:




Market First LP Index Tokens



Vaultka will be launching two types Perp DEX Index Token: a Mega LP token, and a Mega Perp DEX Governance Token


The Mega token will be a combination of LP/Governance tokens from top Perp DEX on Arbitrum, as well as lower scale Perp DEX LPs that provide much higher yield to users but also high risk exposures


It diversify the risk of smaller scale Perp DEX LP tokens but keeping users with the upside potential of these tokens


The composition of the Mega tokens will be closely monitored to ensure holders are well protected


This matches our ideology of encouraging users to engage in different Perp DEX on Arbitrum, where users can now deposit and mint Index Tokens to keep their exposure on these long-tailed protocols, but without taking much additional risks






Alt-coin lending



Vaultka fully understands that in order to attract more lending capital to the LP Perp DEX market, stablecoin should not be the only option for users to opt for. Vaultka is actively exploring alt-coin lending pools (ETH & ARB tokens) to allow users to lend their idle alt-coin capital to the Perp DEX LP market and earn additional yield


This unlocks even more lending capital and fully unleashes the potential of Perp DEX LP market






Integration with Pendle Principle Tokens



Vaultka is also exploring the possibility to integrate Pendle Principle Tokens to our product - Mega LP Tokens and lending pools


This allow users to restake their Principle tokens from Pendle and unlocks more yield options






Issuance of LP backed stablecoin → unlocked even more liquidity/value to the whole Arbitrum Defi ecosystem



Vaultka will be issuing the market first LP backed stablecoin


Given the stable and asset-backed nature of LP tokens, they can be treated as a store of value and used as collateral to create additional liquidity to the market


This opens up additional value and potential not only for the Perp DEX but for the entire DeFi ecosystem. It enables users to generate extra yield while maintaining liquidity efficiency.






Exploration of New LP:



Vaultka remains committed to ongoing exploration and integration with various Perp DEX platforms on Arbitrum, broadening our product offerings.


Notably, we have HLP (LP for HMX) and SLLP (LP for Level Finance) prepared for imminent launch in the upcoming weeks.


Our dedication lies in uniting all Perp DEX platforms on Arbitrum, providing protocols with increased visibility and attention on their respective platforms

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives
:




Onboard the users of our centralized exchange WOO X into Arbitrum


Recruit on-chain users into Arbitrum through WOOFi cross-chain swaps and campaigns


Support the growth of Arbitrum dApps through our cross-chain swap widget


Up the user transaction count on Arbitrum to generate more sequencer revenue


Reinforce Arbitrum as WOOFi’s go-to chain for new and innovative product launches




Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
:




Grow WOOFi Arbitrum TVL and Monthly trading volume by 200%


Increase the number of users that onboard Arbitrum using WOOFi cross chain swaps by 200%


Achieve at least 3 inter-protocol integrations that benefit Arbitrum users


Launch WOOFi Pro mainnet with Arbitrum as the main deposit vault




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
:


Within the WOO ecosystem reside more than 120,000 registered and active CEX traders that consistently move $150m-$400m in daily volume. Being the decentralized arm of the WOO ecosystem, WOOFi enjoys a fortunate position as the go-to entrypoint into DeFi for these traders. Provided we qualify for a grant, we can funnel these users onto WOOFi and intro Arbitrum through a combination of incentives deployed in the swap, stake, and earn components of our DEX. The more ARB rewards we qualify for, the greater leverage we’ll have to make Arbitrum the de facto on-chain hub for our ever-growing number of CeFi users who can elevate the ecosystem’s trading volume and daily transactions.


Beyond the wealth of CeFi traders that WOOFi has at its disposal to onboard into Arbitrum, WOOFi can bring in a swathe of new users from other Layer 2s. We will do this by using the grant to lead large-scale campaigns that incentivize users to cross-chain swap into Arbitrum from Ethereum, Linea, Base, Optimism, and other chains we support. This is a playbook we have already used to great effect in our 
5-day Arbitrum adventure
 which was responsible for onboarding 7,000 users into Arbitrum in less than 2 hours. Few other protocols can say they have brought as many users into Arbitrum as WOOFi, now having facilitated 1.1M cross-chain swaps into Arbitrum. A grant will help to multiply this number as we host campaign after campaign with a wide array of partners such as Layer3, Galxe, Intract, QuestN, and more.


They say a rising tide lifts all ships, and our soon-to–be-launched cross-chain swap SDK will do exactly that for all Arbitrum protocols. By integrating with our solution, any Arbitrum dApp can have their very own widget that enables their users to swap any asset from any major EVM chain into any asset on Arbitrum. Provided we receive a grant, we will utilize a portion of this ARB to cross-market with and promote Arbitrum dApps that leverage our widget, rewarding users of their front ends who move assets into Arbitrum. By upping the visibility and accessibility of these promising Arbitrum dApps through our multichain onboarding solution, we can spur a new wave of users to explore and infiltrate every single vertical of Arbitrum.


Lastly, we will leverage this grant to ensure widespread usage of new and exciting WOOFi products deployed exclusively on Arbitrum, reinforcing that Arbitrum is our chain of choice for innovation. WOOFi started to become heavily Arbitrum-centric in May with the launch of WOOFi Stake 2.0, and we will take our relationship to the next level in October when we deploy the first vault of our new flagship orderbook trading product on Arbitrum. In the event that we are rewarded with a grant, we will use some of the ARB to propel the adoption of WOOFi Pro with incentives, setting in stone Arbitrum’s reputation as the default ecosystem for on-chain traders who seek high performance and unmatched execution.


Justification for the size of the grant
:


Unlike other protocols in the ecosystem, WOOFi is in a unique and privileged position to bring Arbitrum a vast influx of new users from across both CeFi and other EVM chains. In addition, we have the capability to catalyze the growth of promising Arbitrum dApps through our cross-chain swap SDK as well as feature them in multiple large-scale and effective campaigns subsidized and organized by ourselves. Our ambition is to move on multiple fronts and go far beyond just incentivizing trading and LP behavior - something which any protocol in the ecosystem can do.


We seek to champion Arbitrum, single-handedly move the needle for new user growth, and ultimately converge our two ecosystems to make Arbitrum part and parcel of the WOOFi brand. By the time our last ARB has been deployed, we will have led 100,000+ WOO X traders into Arbitrum and motivated countless more on-chain users now exploring other L2s to make Arbitrum their forever home. We recognize these are no small goals, which is why we ask for no small amount of ARB.


Execution Strategy
:


Arbitrum inbound cross-chain swap incentives (15%)


Incentivize users from the other ecosystems in which WOOFi is deployed to move their assets into Arbitrum. Methods may include but are not limited to:




fee refund for cross-chain swapping into Arbitrum


reward users to cross swap into Arbitrum eco tokens with assets on other chains


rewards for users who enter Arbitrum through dApps that use WOOFi’s cross-chain SDK




Swap incentives (10%)


Encourage the 120,000+ traders of our CEX to go onchain and make Arbitrum their go-to chain when swapping with WOOFi. This will boost both Arbitrum’s overall trading volume and user activity. Methods may include but are not limited to:




rewards for users who swap with WOOFi’s liquidity on Arbitrum through brokers


volume-based rewards for users who swap on Arbitrum through WOOFi’s front end




WOOFi Pro incentives (20%)


Incentivize our 400K MAU to deposit in the Arbitrum vaults of WOOFi Pro and trade. WOOFi Pro will be framed as an Arbitrum product first and foremost, showcasing to the world that Arbitrum is the logical choice for onchain traders hunting a gasless platform with the execution of a CEX and self custody of a DEX. Incentivized pairs will include:




ETH - PERP


BTC - PERP




(Rewards will be distributed on a periodical basis according to the rules).


WOOFi Earn rewards (30%)


Scale up WOOFi’s capital efficient sPMM liquidity on Arbitrum to provide even better price and slippage for on-chain swappers. Increase Arbitrum TVL by making it an even more attractive ecosystem for providing liquidity through all-new WOOFi Supercharger vaults incentivized by ARB rewards. New users from other chains will be drawn into Arbitrum as they seek to earn leading single-sided yield.


Rewards will be allocated to WOOFi Supercharger vault (including ETH, USDC, ARB and wstETH) and automatically distributed via the smart contract every second.


WOOFi Stake rewards (15%)


Incentivize new users to stake their WOO on Arbitrum, motivate existing WOOFi stakers on all 5 other chains to interact with Arbitrum more frequently, and reinforce that Arbitrum is the de facto hub of WOOFi staking and WOO token liquidity. Rewards will be added on top of the swap fees and distributed via the rewarder smart contract every second.


Quests and cross-protocol integration (10%)


Reward users who take part in large-scale arbitrum campaigns led by WOOFi to incentivize integration between Arbitrum eco projects. The goal of this part is mainly to facilitate collaborations between Arbitrum ecosystem projects. We would organize campaigns involving other Arbitrum projects with the purposes of 1) attracting users from other ecosystem and incentivizing participation; 2) raise the awareness of integration (existing and new) between WOOFi and other Arbitrum projects that could benefit users. (Rewards will be distributed on a periodical basis according to the rules).


Details of each transaction from the grant multisig wallet will be reported.

Project Name:
 Artichoke Protocol


Project Description:
 Artichoke is a single-sided liquidity protocol (SSLP) built on top of the Arbitrum Network. Artichoke enables users to provide liquidity to a universal liquidity pool (Omnipool) using only a single asset on top of AMMs - unlocking the yield opportunities in DeFi liquidity provision for everyone.


The Omnipool is comprised of isolated subpools, further referred to as “tails” which enable single-asset liquidity provision (for example for tokens like GMX, GRAIL, MAGIC, ARB etc) - all tails are interlinked through the synthetic liquidity asset tCHOKE. More information can be found in our

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size:
 370K ARB


Grant Matching:
 Current CHOKE/USDC LP on Camelot can immediately start rewarding ARB allocation with 
CHOKE
 rewards on Nitro Pools.


Grant Breakdown:
 Upon receiving the grant, we plan to allocate the funds in the following manner:






60% (222K ARB) for Liquidity Incentives over Artichoke’s Omnipool and Tails, distributed alongside users that allocate funds to specific Tails






26% (96,6K ARB) for LP incentives for a newly set up $CHOKE/ARB pool on Camelot






14% (51,8K ARB) allocation for future partner tail deployment & incentives






Funding Address:

)


Funding Address Characteristics:
 ⅔ Multisig.


Contract Address:
 TBD when Omnipool and Tails are live.


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives:
 This grant will be used to incentivize Omnipools growth and help the Artichoke ecosystem grow as a whole.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):






Omnipool TVL:
 We aim to achieve sustainable and constant TVL growth across the Omnipool with a 2 Million USD equivalent being a first milestone.






Number of tailAssets supported by the Omnipool:
 Starting out with 4 supported tokens initially (USDC, ARB, CHOKE and PartnerTail) as a stable basis, we aim to add at least 2 new tail assets per month for 6 months, focusing primarily on Arbitrum native projects with proven track record that show growth potential.






Trade volume:
 Trade volume routed through the Omnipool shall follow the growing TVL & tailAsset metrics and show consitent growth - tracking via Dune dashboards on a daily/weekly/monthly level will be made available upon mainnet deployment.






These 3 key metrics are in our opinion ideal to monitor platform utilization and growth in order to provide verifiable proof of the effectiveness of potential incentive campaigns in an AMM/SSLP setting.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


Artichoke’s primary aim is deepening liquidity for Arbitrum native projects, many of which struggle with an overabundance of idle treasury tokens & fractured liquidity - both of which can be addressed by our Omnipool-based single-sided liquidity solutions. Project teams & DAOs can utilize their native tokens by setting up a tail on our protocol without the need to use additional treasury funds held in ETH or stablecoins for pairing.


The simplicity and low-risk (pertaining to Impermanent Loss risk) design of Artichoke can open the Arbitrum ecosystem up to liquidity providers who are seeking new yield opportunities without having to engage with the complexities of token pairs, liqudity ranges, impermanent loss etc. - thus providing growth opportunities for the entire ecosystem and first-mover advantage for Arbitrum DeFi.


Being able to provide incentives to kickstart TVL growth & tail deployment will be a catalyst not only for Artichoke’s growth, but all projects whose native assets are supported by the Omnipool via tails.


In order to scale and maintain this piece of potentially critical DeFi infrastructure, there can be no compromises made on the security side - audits by highly reputable providers & bounty programs are required to ensure the safety of user funds & foster user’s and partner’s trust in the protocol - the portion of the grant not used for incentive programs will be dedicated to these efforts.


In order to scale and maintain this piece of potentially critical DeFi infrastructure, there can be no compromises made on the security side - audits by highly reputable providers & bounty programs are required to ensure the safety of user funds & foster user’s and partner’s trust in the protocol.


Justification for the size of the grant:


Our main objective is TVL growth for Arbitrum, establishing ARB as a default asset in DeFi both in pair based AMMs & SSLPs, and the growth of Artichoke through deployment of additional tails of partnered Arbitrum projects - the grant request & intended use are built around these three aspects.


1. TVL growth/LP incentives
 
- requested funds: 370K ARB


ARB incentives for liquidity providers to kickstart TVL growth for Artichoke will be tailored such, that rewards are allocated towards the most relevant tails & can be sustained until Feb 2024, the intended date by which all grant funds of this round are to be utilized by recipients


Besides incentivizing liquidity provision for core assets such as ETH, USDC & ARB, rewards for newly added tails by Arbitrum ecosystem partners are another important element meant to foster Arbitrum’s cohesion & mutually beneficial growth - in order to mitigate predatory listings (for example to “farm” ARB rewards), adding of new/low liquidity assets is to be a guided process and subject to community consensus.


2. Establishing ARB as a core DeFi asset


We strongly believe that the ARB token will play a vital part not only in the governance but also in the liquidity landscape of Arbitrum and beyond - as a core pairing asset besides ETH and stablecoins.


As the native asset, organic demand for ARB should be facilitated wherever possible - in the context of this grant request, we aim to launch an ARB/CHOKE pool on Camelot as our second main pair besides ARB/USDC and incentivize LPs via Nitropool rewards.


This initiative goes hand in hand with deploying the ARB tail as a “Day 1” asset of the Artichoke Omnipool, allowing anyone to provide liquidity for it without the need to pair with other assets.


3. Artichoke Protocol growth


Following the deployment of the initial USDC, ARB & CHOKE tails, the Omnipool is equipped to onboard project tokens with lower liquidity & higher expected volatility - a base pool of relatively stable assets is required as a foundational buffer upon which these “riskier” tails can be layered.


The ability of the Omnipool to absorb and thereby utilise formerly dormant treasury tokens without the need to pair with other assets, offers project teams an avenue towards deeper liquidity and revenue, which in turn helps with sustainability, strengthens investor confidence and makes for an overall healthier ecosystem.


Artichoke aims to onboard all relevant Arbitrum ecosystem projects as partners & add tails for their native tokens to the Omnipool.


In order to incentivize deployment of new tails & maintain a high TVL for these tokens, a portion of the grant will be used for LP incentives as well as one-time rewards for successful deployment.


Ultimately the Omnipool should contain significant liquidity for all established Arbitrum native project tokens & offer a low barrier to entry for new LPs through single-sided liquidity provision - serving as a central piece of DeFi on the network.


Execution Strategy:
 If ARB funds are allocated to Artichoke’s Ecosystem, we will immediately start incentivizing existing pools on current AMMs (Camelot V2 & V3). On the other hand, after completing all the necessary security audits, we will start deploying Omnipool tails such as:




ARB/tCHOKE


USDC/tCHOKE (with ARB incentives)


Further pools: ETH/tCHOKE, wBTC/tCHOKE, GRAIL/tCHOKE, GMX/tCHOKE, LINK/tCHOKE




Artichoke will take into account pairs that are already being incentivized such as the CHOKE/USDC pair on Camelot.

Applicant Name:
 CVI


Project Name: CVI
 (Crypto volatility index)


Project Description:


CVI, the Crypto Volatility Index, is the first and only decentralized and fully operational ‘VIX’-like product exclusively tailored for the crypto market. It leverages Chainlink oracles to extract on-chain option prices for 30-day periods on BTC and ETH, and delivers a decentralized On-Chain volatility index, providing a reliable gauge of market sentiment and implied volatility. CVI serves as the premier platform for decentralized volatility trading in the cryptocurrency space. Our latest protocol updates introduce industry-standard features, real yield, leverage positions, a hedging solution to the Theta vault, and the thrilling UCVI index.


One of our flagship offerings, the Theta Vault, has proven not only profitable but also capable of providing real yield to liquidity providers. Our commitment to innovation and improvement is unwavering, and we believe that the forthcoming protocol updates will be pivotal in our quest to foster even more growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem.


Scheduled for release next month, these updates include:






New UCVI (Ultra CVI) - x3 Volatility Index! We’re introducing the new Ultra CVI, which will offer volatility traders a three-fold increase in volatility exposure. This expansion will diversify our product offerings and cater to a wider range of traders.






Hedging Feature for the Theta Vault: Our innovative hedging feature will enhance risk management for liquidity providers in the Theta Vault. This risk mitigation measure will lead to a substantial reduction in funding fees, making our platform even more attractive for traders.






Up to x16 Leverage: To meet the demands of advanced traders, we’re introducing leverage options of up to x16. This will empower traders to optimize their strategies and potentially amplify their returns.






Referral Program: We’re excited to unveil a referral program that will reward users for bringing new participants to the CVI ecosystem. This program aims to strengthen our community and encourage further growth (No $ARB incentives for this program).






Support for concentrated liquidity for the CVI and UCVI Volatility tokens by integrating with Uniswap v3 on Arbitrum






With these enhancements on the horizon, we anticipate a dramatic increase in the number of Theta Vault deposits and active traders on our platform. CVI.finance remains dedicated to providing innovative solutions for volatility trading while fostering a thriving community on the Arbitrum network and we would be delighted to receive this grant to help up achieving this.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size:
 200,000 $ARB


Grant Matching:
 We are currently seeking a 200,000 ARB grant to enhance activity on the CVI platform. As part of our updated protocol, we are introducing $esGOVI incentives for active traders. Currently, liquidity providers are receiving incentives in the form of $esGOVI. If we are successful in obtaining the ARB grant, we will additionally incentivize both traders and liquidity providers with $ARB alongside the $esGOVI rewards.


Grant Breakdown:




Incentivize Active Volatility Traders on the CVI Platform








Budget: 60% of 200,000 $ARB = 120,000 $ARB






These funds will be used to incentivize active traders participating in volatility trading on the CVI platform. This will include rewards, bonuses, or other incentives to encourage trading activity.








Incentivize Liquidity Providers to the Theta Vault








Budget: 40% of 200,000 $ARB = 80,000 $ARB






These funds will be allocated to incentivize liquidity providers who contribute to the Theta Vault on the CVI platform. The aim is to attract and retain new liquidity providers to enhance the ecosystem and to allow a greater use to the protocol.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size
: 50,000 $ARB


Grant Breakdown:

We aim to create 
two major in-game collaborative events with distinguished game partners on other blockchains
 to onboard new users/players. With the success of the previous Pixelmon World Boss event in onboarding newcomers (see stats below), we are planning to replicate the success with other prominent games on other chains.


World Boss Incentives (50,000 $ARB)

To incentivise players to engage with Tales of Elleria’s gameplay on Arbitrum One through attractive reward pools accompanying cross-chain partnerships, and by extension be exposed to the Arbitrum Ecosystem.


Funding Address:

0x69832Af74774baE99D999e7F74FE3F7d5833bF84


Funding Address Characteristics:

This is Tales of Elleria’s Multisig Gnosis Safe address, with 5 keys controlling the safe. Each key is given to a founder and one key is locked in a CISCO Safe-deposit Box as a backup. Transactions within the safe require a majority (¾) signature and approval.


Contract Address:

Reward Distribution Contract: 0x71001e0EA8Ea4C9fc99B187e695969FaBCCe1828


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION

Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives:

Our primary goal of the grant is to expand the game’s player base while introducing new players to the Arbitrum ecosystem through special 
in-game events in collaboration with partners on other blockchains
 and convert them 
into actual players
. These events, specifically the “World Boss” event, incentivize players/holders from partner projects to join our platform.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Recently, we had a collaboration with a prominent L1 NFT project called Pixelmon. We integrated their famous 
“Kevin” character IP into our game and acted as a World Boss
. Through this event, Tales of Elleria managed to bring in more than 
125 new players
 from Ethereum Mainnet into the Arbitrum ecosystem and players fought “Kevin” 
more than 5000 times within 2 weeks
. In terms of retention, we saw a 
D-7 retention ratio of more than 50%
 during this event. This information is readily available by querying our GraphQL endpoints.


We are also open to considering other forms of KPIs set by the DAO and are willing to create analytics to monitor these KPIs. While most of the above mentioned statistics are in-game metrics, we can create dune dashboards to monitor on-chain data that identifies new-comers to Arbitrum who interacted with our shop or contract addresses (purchasing heroes, entry tickets, consumables, etc).


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:

The grant will help us drastically as we are able to foster new collaborations more confidently through a major prize pool. We will use the grant as incentives to drive new players into the Arbitrum ecosystem. Not only that, we can utilize the grant to improve the overall user gaming experience.


Justification for the size of the grant:

The grant size that we are requesting includes a forecast for integrating 
IP for 2 of the biggest games among other chains
 (Currently in talks).


World Boss Incentive Reward Budget

We aim to apportion a 25,000 $ARB prize pool per campaign over 2 campaigns in 4 months. Both existing players and new users within and outside the Arbitrum ecosystem have shown the 
highest level of interest
 in our past “World Bosses”, planning to challenge the in-game leaderboard for rewards. From there, we will include a portion of the entry fee to grow the prize pool as more players participate. Overall, our past events with at least 10,000 USD prize pool saw the highest participation rate of over 5,000 entries and we intend to shatter past records with the 2 upcoming world bosses that we can introduce with this new $ARB grant.


We see a great opportunity to apply for the grant to continue to increase our player base while attracting new players to come into Arbitrum, as it ties very deeply with the interoperability concepts that we have succeeded in proving in the past.


Execution Strategy:

We have run 9 World Boss events before and we managed to hit our KPI every time, as such, we will utilize the grant in an efficient manner. Our marketing lead, YellowPanther, who is also a KOL in the gaming space with 90,000 followers on Twitter has many connections to games from different chains.


Currently, we aim to work with games from Avalanche and Ronin Network. We aim to push for new collaborations, in order to tap into their existing player base and convert them into new players in Arbitrum through our in-game special events.


We are confident in the execution strategy of targeting cross-platform games to bring users over as shown in the recent collaboration event with pixelmon that succeeded in onboarding new players. We fully intend to replicate, if not better, the favourable result of these campaigns.


Grant Timeline:

We aim to bring in 
two new World Boss Events
 from different games/IP in the next 4 months. Upon the confirmation of the grant, we will begin development for the first integration of IP by creating features and assets for the campaigns.


The estimated timeline of each campaign lasts 2 months. Each campaign will include 4 weeks of preparation time, 2 weeks of the actual event, and 2 weeks for post-event review and reward distribution.


1st Event Duration: 13th - 26th November 2023

2nd Event Duration: 8th - 21st January 2023


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?

Yes


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Provide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:

Yes.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed:

Only Arbitrum.


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?:

31st March 2022.


Protocol Performance:

Tales of Elleria seeks to redefine the conventional gaming journey. Instead of presenting a fully fleshed-out game at launch, we embrace an evolutionary approach, unveiling features progressively. This unique strategy crafts an unfolding, journey-like experience, ensuring our players remain engaged, surprised, and ever-curious about the next chapter. Here are the features that we have launched over the past year till date: Minting, Gasless Gameplay, Assignments (staking), Explorations (staking), Quest (turn-based gameplay), Relics, Crafting, Wishing Well (burning), Consumables, Artifacts, Levelling, Tower of Babel (Alternate questing), $ELM Token, LP incentives, Cosmetics, Progressive Packages and Free-to-Play characters among other smaller updates.


In terms of partnerships, we had partnered with over 20 different games and tried to include their IP in our game among many others.


Player Statistics

• 13,700 Registered Players.

• 2,000 Hero NFT Holders.

• 652 Active Users in August.

• 243 Participants in the Latest Event, of which 125 were new Arbitrum wallets.


Marketplace Statistics:

• Heroes collection had 1,400,000 $MAGIC traded since inception.

• Relics collection had 255,000 $MAGIC traded since inception.


Token Statistics:

• $ELM Liquidity Pool is currently valued at 190,000 USD.


Roadmap:

In terms of roadmap, Tales of Elleria is just beginning.


1600×983 204 KB

We find ourselves situated at currently building out more game complexity while creating more features for Tales of Elleria until the point where we have enough depth to compete with Traditional Web 2.0 games. Once we’ve developed enough features, and enhanced immersion by introducing graphical and audio improvement, while simplifying the onboarding process, we intend to include cross-platform compatibility to compete with other prominent games out in the market. Through these, we aim to expand Elleria’s IP as we build out other games like Elleria Racers to further expand upon Elleria Studios.


Audit

Back in April, Tales of Elleria underwent a devastating LP hack. Since then, we have tripled down on security and have fully audited our tokens, fully recovering and resuming normal operations. You can find more about the audit here:


https://0xmacro.com/library/audits/tales-of-elleria-1


Coming back from this negative event is also proof of our community’s unwavering support as players, rarely seen anywhere else in Web 3.0. It is also proof that our team is able to handle our community members well to ensure the retention of players.


SECTION 5: Data and Reporting


Provide details on how your team is equipped to provide data and reporting on grant distribution.


Is your team prepared to create Dune Spells and/or Dashboards for your incentive program?:

Yes. Although we have our internal dashboard for monitoring in-game data, we are open to developing alternative dashboards tailored to the grant program.


Does your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread?:

Yes. We are willing to share the team’s progress and updates regarding the onboarding program and all ongoing events.


Does your team acknowledge that failure to comply with any of the above requests can result in the halting of the program’s funding stream?:

Yes."

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size: 500,000 $ARB (reduced request, prev. 650,000 $ARB)


Grant Matching:


Yes
. SpartaDEX will continue to incentivize pools alongside the $ARB tokens provided by this grant. The exact number is estimated to be between 
2 to 3 million of $SPARTA tokens until the end of the grant distribution period.


Grant Breakdown:


Upon receiving the grant, we plan to allocate the funds in the following manner, with distribution set to continue until the end of January 2024:






70% (increased from 60% - 10% has been reallocated from SAS pool) - Liquidity Incentives for Trading Pairs:
 This portion of the grant will be used to offer rewards for new liquidity providers for both existing and newly added trading pairs on SpartaDEX. Our current TVL is around $10M split across just 6 pairs. When compared to other leading DEXes on Arbitrum the liquidity on each of our major pairs is competitive.






30% - Incentives for Liquidity of the New Projects that will have the IDO on our Launchpad:
 This substantial allocation is aimed at attracting new projects to launch their Initial DEX Offering (IDO) via Sparta Launchpad. What is more, we provide them with an added advantage: our experienced Rust developers can offer advisory services and conduct smart contract audits. This is included as a part of our service package.






We find below points crucial for understanding of the breakdown of 30% allocated to projects that will have their IDO on our Launchpad:


1.
 SpartaDEX will host IDOs of at least 5 projects on Sparta Launchpad until the end of January 2024. To each project there will be a max of 
6% $ARB tokens (5 x 6% = 30%) allocated for incentivizing liquidity


2.
 If SpartaDEX doesn’t launch 5 projects, the remaining funds will be returned to the wallet provided by Arbitrum Foundation. We will not keep these funds.


In case it will be known for us in advance that we won’t manage to launch 5 projects, which we find unlikely considering what’s happening on the backstage, we will move remaining % to reward existing liquidity.


3.
 The allocation for incentives rewards of each project will depend on the liquidity.


In the event that any portion of the grant remains undistributed for any reason, the SpartaDEX team commits to returning the unused funds to the originating multisignature wallet.


This transparent and carefully planned allocation ensures that the grant will serve as a catalyst for growth, attracting both new users and high-quality projects to the Arbitrum ecosystem via SpartaDEX.


Funding Address:


0xA474b646Ff92968c08ECc6388228AB18235F3844


Important to note: Funds from this address will be sent to multiple smart contracts that will be deployed later on, and distributed according to ‘Grant Breakdown’ section.


Funding Address Characteristics: [Enter details on the status of the address, eligible address must be a 2/3 multisig with private keys securely stored]


The aforementioned wallet is a 3/5 multisignature solution where each stakeholder authorizes messages through a hardware wallet.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): [Specify the KPIs that will be used to measure success in achieving the grant objectives]


To closely align with our objectives, we will be diligently monitoring the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):


1. Total Value Locked (TVL):




Liquidity for existing trading pairs on our DEX


Liquidity for new trading pairs involving existing projects on our DEX


Liquidity for new trading pairs linked to projects launching via Sparta Launchpad




2. User Engagement Metrics:




Trading volume, evaluated on both daily and monthly scales


Transaction counts, assessed daily and monthly


Active user participation in both the DEX and the gamified ecosystem, quantified on daily and monthly bases


New game participants, determined by unique wallets that have minted a free NFT from SpartaDEX Polis




3. In-Game Metrics:




Purchases of premium in-game currency, captured by on-chain transactions for acquiring ‘Gems’ using $SPARTA tokens


Progress markers like building levels and engagement metrics such as activities in attacking Barbarian Camps within the game




4. New Project Launch Metrics:




Number of quality projects conducting Initial DEX Offerings (IDOs) on our launchpad


Overall value raised through these IDOs




5. Marketing Outreach Metrics:




Reach and engagement levels on Twitter to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing and awareness campaigns




By keeping an attentive eye on these KPIs, we aim to continuously adapt and optimize our strategies, thereby ensuring the ongoing growth and success of the SpartaDEX ecosystem within Arbitrum.

The grant will facilitate the improvement of yield mechanics, encouraging projects that are looking for the best chain for their launch to consider building on Arbitrum.


Justification for the size of the grant:


SpartaDEX is a native Arbitrum DEX and Launchpad gathering a strong community of devoted users. With the liquidity of more than 
$10 millions, of which the majority is locked in the Lockdrop for a period of 52 weeks
, we have already proved that our community is vibrant and devoted.


The size of the grant was carefully discussed within our Team, DAO and the most committed members of our community - Elders.


We are a new and innovative protocol, the first gamified DEX native to Arbitrum, the first to organize the lockdrop event and we believe that we brought a huge value to the whole ecosystem, while aiming to bring ten times more, through:






Bringing high quality projects to Arbitrum space






Increase user engagement and DEX metrics






Execution Strategy: [Describe the plan for executing including resources, products, use of funds, and risk management. This includes allocations for specific pools, eligible assets, products, etc.]


Funds will be distributed through smart contracts for certain pools. Existing pools that will be incentivized are all the pools available on SpartaDEX:




WETH/ARB


WETH/USDC


WBTC/WETH


SPARTA/USDC


GSWIFT/USDC


USDT/USDC




THESE ARE JUST INITIAL THE POOLS, WE WILL DEPLOY MORE AFTER POTENTIAL GRANT RECEIVING.


The funds will be used solely to achieve our objectives. Team is not in possession of the SPARTA-USDC liquidity as it was added exclusively by the community, we will not benefit from the grant funds.


Grant Timeline: [Describe the timeline for the grant]


Grant funds will be distributed until the end of January 2024.


SpartaDEX Team will create a dashboard in which all of the metrics and KPIs are tracked to ensure that the hypotheses are being positively verified.


If this proposal is greater than 1M ARB, please provide details on any funding tranches or milestones your application aims to abide by:

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size
: 195,000 ARB


Grant Matching
: N/A


Grant Breakdown
: The funds raised will be utilized for distribution of ARB through Arbitrum based contracts for NFT developers, builders, and creators, and contracts that allow for protocols to incentivize the trading of unique collections with ARB incentives on the new campaign we will launch aimed towards incentivizing new user growth through a brand new gamified incentive campaign on Arbitrum. We will also use the ARB incentives to increase NFT liquidity across Arbitrum - by incentivizing creating listings / making bids - (building NFT liquidity) - in addition to just trading on the NFT marketplace contracts. This is to emulate in large part the success Blur experience on Mainnet. We think Arbitrum can be home to a more well-designed and fun campaign to spark NFT activity across the ecosystem.


Funding Address
: NFTEarth DAO Multisig: 0xC24223341415Bc8CaB0ffA5C2A6200d835fB1FF5


Funding Address Characteristics
: This is a Safe Multisig, with a 3/7 confirmation requirement in place for executing transactions.


Contract Address
: N/A at present - A potential use case that has been discussed for this would potentially include the Seaport Wrapper contract to be developed to incentivize trading on specific NFT collections with $ARB tokens, and other similar contracts like this where other partner protocols across the Arbitrum ecosystem can simply work with the NFTEarth team to incentivize whatever NFT collection they would like to, helping the entire Arbitrum ecosystem at large.


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives
: The primary objectives for this grant are to drive user adoption to Arbitrum in the non-fungible space by creating 
new
 and novel utility and experiences from what currently exists in the NFT landscape. We believe that Arbitrum can become the home to NFT activity across all of web3 given the low transaction costs and existing large user base. We also believe a new strategy needs to be executed on to achieve this, because what has been attempted thus far, not only on L2s, but Mainnet as well, is not working. With our native protocol token NFTE that can be used in conjunction with many marketplace activities, we can create and environment for real stickiness of user growth, as opposed to what has been observed with numerous grant distribution programs that have nearly always led to the funds being used as nothing more than mercenary capital. The team has acquired significant experience in why making the transition for users to L2s is so difficult and will use this in all decision making to increase the overall trading of NFTs on Arbitrum as opposed to on Ethereum Mainnet. If you really take a minute to think about it; it is really odd that after all the time of L2s being live, Arbitrum, that NFT activity has remained completely stagnant despite lower cost solutions existing - we plan to leverage our views as to 
why
 this is the case to the fullest extent possible in order to create 
real
 and powerful momentum away from Mainnet to Arbitrum, both in terms of users and volume in USD.


Our proposal aims to implement a strategic rewards distribution approach that not only garners substantial participation in the Arbitrum ecosystem and catalyzes NFT activity, but also yields measurable and impactful outcomes that can be directly attributed to the campaigns implemented by NFTEarth, such as the very first campaign, which will be a trade-to-earn campaign where liquidity and volume is incentivized, and boosted incentives are provided to those who move from Ethereum Mainnet to Arbitrum.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
:






Total new users interacting with marketplace contracts. As of right now, there are essentially ~0 daily active NFT traders per NFTScan and other NFT analytics platforms. Ethereum Mainnet giants like OpenSea and Blur are averaging around 10,000 and 2,000 respectively. We believe we can onboard this many users with a well targeted and designed campaign to show why users should be conducting their NFT transactions on Arbitrum.






Volume in $ USD traded on Arbitrum. Similar to unique addresses, this number in real-time is very low. By offering incentives to large traders on Mainnet, and using distribution channels to reach them that we know they are available at (onchain messaging via DeBank for instance, onchain queries made to Galxe for new campaigns, etc.) we can convince them to move to Arbitrum and finally create a sustainable non-fungible marketplace and ecosystem for all of Arbitrum to benefit from and have for many years to come.






How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
: Building the infrastructure for UX similar to mainnet is lacking sorely on Arbitrum, as well as incentivized campaigns for trading and creating non-fungible collections and other use cases. By using the grant to incentivize NFT activity, many new users will join the Arbitrum ecosystem and conduct a multitude of transactions types as well such as Minting, Buying, Selling, Creating NFTs, etc.


Justification for the size of the grant
: This is an appropriate size grant because it will provide enough runway for the team to demonstrate powerful and tangible results, while also within a short enough time frame to advance to the next stages of planned growth. The vision for NFTEarth is to become the largest NFT and non-fungible protocol in web3, with the aim to outperform OpenSea and Blur in both volume and users, but this will take more time than what is being presented here in this specific grant proposal, but is part of the long-term roadmap nonetheless.


Execution Strategy
: 50% of the of the funds will be used to incentivize building NFT liqduitiy on Arbitrum (creating listings and making bids).


30% of the of the funds will be used to incentivize trading activity on Arbitrum specific collections, as well as bring new collection creators to Layer2.


20% of the funds will be used in direct outreach to existing collections and potentially new ones to incentivize them to come to Arbitrum to create and trade / build their communities.


Funds will be held and distributed on the following 3/7 multisig address: 0xC24223341415Bc8CaB0ffA5C2A6200d835fB1FF5


Grant Timeline
: Based on the distribution schedule planned and already budgeted costs to build the necessary infrastructure to create a world-class NFT experience for users on Arbitrum, the grant will be distributed in total within 4 months of approval. Growth metrics dashboards will be submitted no later than one week after each month that passes among the various initiatives. After the grant period concludes, NFTEarth is committed to extensive evaluation of the grant’s impact in order to determine what worked well, and what could be optimized, and share this data for all protocols looking to help grow the Arbitrum ecosystem.


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?
 Yes


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Provide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?
: Yes - Arbitrum is the focus of NFTEarth at this point in time. The team believes in a cross-chain future, but has chosen to launch its long-term staking program on Arbitrum and focus on building NFT user traction on Arbitrum as well.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?
: Ethereum, Base, Optimism, Linea, Mantle, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Polygon


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?
: February, 2023


Protocol Performance
: NFTEarth is a young protocol - with high visibility and large ambitions for growth and a targeted strategy for user acquisition to Arbitrum and transaction growth on Arbitrum. The team has already built and launched a successful gamified airdrop campaign that led to an active daily user count of 264 users as measured onchain by NFTScan. We plan to increase this by multiple times on Arbitrum.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant. 


 


Requested Grant Size:  


640,000 ARB = 40,000 ARB per week for 16 weeks.


 


Grant Matching: 


The incentives below are already live and will be carried on in parallel with the ARB grant (if approved). 




We have an ALP Syrup Pool (Stake ALP, Earn CAKE) on PancakeSwap to reward ALP stakers. The emissions in total are 500 CAKE and 25000 APX (APX converted to CAKE for distribution) per day. (~25% of the grants value)




We currently inject 25% of V2 trading fees on Arbitrum to reward top Arbitrum traders






 


Grant Breakdown: 




4/5 of the grant (512,000 ARB) will be used as trading incentives for ApolloX V2 (oracle-based on-chain perp trading)


1/5 of the grant (128,000 ARB) will be used as liquidity incentives for ALP, the liquidity provider of V2 trading




Each week, 32,000 ARB and 8,000 ARB will be distributed as trading incentives and liquidity incentives respectively.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


 


Objectives: 




Incentivize V2 perpetual trading activity on Arbitrum, hence increasing volume, transactions, active users, and sequencer fees for Arbitrum


Incentivize liquidity providers on Arbitrum to mint and stake ALP (platform LP token), hence increasing TVL for Arbitrum, while facilitating more volume in point 1




 


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): 


Target metrics for ApolloX V2 by 31 January 2024:




Daily trading volume: $50 million 


Daily fees: $20,000


Daily traders: 200


ALP TVL: $30 million




These metrics will be tracked on this Dune dashboard.


 


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?: 


Increase derivatives activity on Arbitrum


This grant will allow us to bolster trading volume and TVL for ApolloX V2, and naturally for Arbitrum as well. We have already been providing trading and liquidity incentives (mentioned above in the Grant Matching section) since we deployed on Arbitrum, but having this grant would allow us to greatly increase the size of our incentive program. 


 


Sizeable liquidity and derivatives activity will also allow other protocols on Arbitrum to build upon us to introduce composable innovative products. Sustainable user activity will help us introduce more derivatives offerings.


 


Support derivatives innovation


ApolloX V2 introduces competitive product features to the Arbitrum ecosystem:




Up to 750x leverage for crypto perps under Degen Mode - the market’s highest


Dynamic fee structure for Degen Mode (as low as 3bps)


5bps trading fee for classic perps - the market’s lowest




 


Having this grant would support our unique offerings within the Arbitrum ecosystem, increasing the competitiveness of the space and encouraging greater innovation among derivatives protocols.


 


Justification for the size of the grant: 


While we have amassed >$100M 30D cumulative volume and >$4M TVL, we understand that ApolloX V2 is still new on Arbitrum. Hence, we have asked for a grant size of 640k ARB to adjust for this factor. 


We are also matching the grants with CAKE + APX tokens that amount to ~25% of the grant value, as well as 25% of all trading fees earned from ApolloX V2 on Arbitrum. This tangibly demonstrates our strong commitment to the Arbitrum ecosystem.


 


Execution Strategy: 


If the grant is approved:




Trading incentives: 




We will upgrade the smart contract of the existing Trading Rewards program on Arbitrum to accommodate disbursement of ARB tokens. Users will be able to claim ARB tokens and trading rewards on the activity page
.


The rules of the upgraded trading rewards will be similar to the existing program,
 but with higher volume for each tier.


New tier structure (Will apply to the distribution of both ARB tokens and 25% of the trading fees):














Tier






Description






Weight










Diamond






Epoch trading amount >=5M USD






5










Gold






Epoch trading amount >=1M USD






3










Silver






Epoch trading amount >= 500K USD






1










 




Liquidity incentives: 




There will be a new ALP Syrup Pool created every two weeks on PancakeSwap (Stake ALP, Earn ARB) to distribute ARB incentives linearly to ALP stakers. This will encourage users to mint ALP.


This will be in addition to the current ALP Syrup Pool (Stake ALP, Earn CAKE) which will be renewed every ~45 days, where we disburse tokens equivalent to ~25% of the grant’s dollar amount.






 


Grant Timeline: 


If the grant is approved, we will immediately start the upgrade of the Trading Rewards smart contract, and distribute the ARB incentives every week. In addition, we will spin up a new Stake ALP, Earn CAKE Syrup Pool every two weeks on PancakeSwap to disburse the ARB incentives to ALP stakers. 


 


The grant will be used over a period of 16 weeks, or approximately 4 months, and will be distributed linearly starting the earliest in early October 2023 and ending on 31 January 2024.


 


Fund Streaming:


Yes

Caveat:


ApolloX’s V2 product is made in partnership with PancakeSwap. Trading on V2 is oracle-based and fully on-chain, with liquidity provided by the ALP pool (composed of stablecoins and blue-chip assets). Users can mint ALP
 and stake ALP in the PancakeSwap Syrup Pool
 to earn staking rewards. ALP minters can also earn platform fees via the gradual appreciation of ALP’s price. "

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives:


WINR Protocol aims to be the premier infrastructure protocol for decentralized gaming.


Compared to existing, centralized platforms where account balances and game mechanics are not independently verifiable, WINR Protocol mechanisms are on-chain, open-source, verifiable and provably fair.


In seeking to build a truly decentralized gaming ecosystem, the WINR Protocol plans to use its Arbitrum grant to bootstrap both sides of its protocol.


The objectives are therefore two-fold:






Acquire game players - Onboard new users to WINR Protocol’s three products, JustBet, DegensBet, and 0xsportsbook, which are all unified under the same universal wallet and account balance.






Attract house liquidity - All WINR products use the same liquidity pool (WLP) as the house liquidity. Scaling this is necessary to onboard large numbers of users. The WLP pool needs to be bootstrapped, but on an ongoing basis, fees will fuel LP returns.






Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):






Acquire game players*


a.  
Daily active users over time

b.  
Daily new users over time

c.  
Daily bet volume over time

d. 
Daily bet value over time (USD)






Attract house liquidity


a. Total value locked in WLP: 3.700.000 USD

b. WLP APR % (excluding incentives): 11.9%










KPIs apply to WINR Protocol as a whole, but will also be separated individually for JustBet, DegensBet, and 0xsportsbet






Incentivizing players by giving them extra rewards is very important in the gaming and gambling industry. As a result of the vWINR incentive campaign we conducted approximately 2 months ago, we experienced up to 20x increase in the number of new players, bet volume, and transactions. With the Arbitrum grant that we will use for 3 months, we aim to reach;




Over 5000 players


Over $100M bet volume


Over $8M TVL.








How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:




Attract attention and liquidity to Arbitum






The success of gambling protocols such as Rollbit, which recently reached a peak market cap of ~$700M, has shown that gaming and gambling have a clear product-market fit


WINR Protocol’s products are superior in that they are fully decentralized, on-chain and provably fair


Moreover, WINR Protocol is built not only for the web3 user but also for the web2 user. Users can create an account simply with an email address, and will eventually be able to fund/onramp money directly to their Arbitrum wallet


WINR’s success can draw hundreds of millions of dollars of TVL and transaction volume to Arbitrum — a rising tide that will lift all boats






Provide Arbitrum builders with a high-quality base layer for gaming






WINR is not a closed protocol; just the opposite, it is intended to be an open protocol for other builders in the Arbitrum ecosystem to easily develop and deploy games without needing to bootstrap liquidity or customer acquisition


Gaming is an ideal use case for Arbitrum’s technology, and WINR Protocol will provide key gaming infrastructure and liquidity for Arbitrum builders and entrepreneurs






Create a new liquidity building block on Arbitrum in WLP






WINR Protocol model allows users to be the house via WLP, creating yield opportunities even for people who don’t want to play the games


Real yield opportunities create more word-of-mouth and marketing for the protocol and for Arbitrum (Ex: In the case of GMX, GLP became a liquidity building block for several other products such as JonesDAO’s vault)


With WINR’s growth, WLP will create more yield opportunities for capital on Arbitrum and more possibilities for the ecosystem to build on top of WLP






Promote the functionality and utility of Arbitrum Orbit






WINR Chain is planned to deploy using Arbitrum Orbit


Success with this deployment would be a great proof point for the Arbitrum ecosystem, significantly as Optimism furthers its “superchain” narrative




Justification for the size of the grant:






Meets requirements: WINR meets the requirements for a Siren 500K ARB grant:




Deployed on Arbitrum mainnet in April 2023


Volume of $63M on WINR’s first product, JustBet


TVL is almost $4M in WINR’s liquidity pool, WLP








Demonstrated track record: WINR has demonstrated a history of shipping high-quality products and features, and a commitment to deployment solely on Arbitrum (see Section 5 for more details)






Attacking a massive opportunity for Arbitrum: The incumbent gaming and gambling protocol, Rollbit, is a large centralized player (with market cap and revenues orders of magnitude larger) – demonstrating both the size of the opportunity for WINR Protocol, but also the capital required to attract attention and liquidity

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives
:


Our proposed budget is carefully crafted to propel growth and enhance efficiency on our Arbitrum platform, concentrating on bolstering volume and liquidity. Here is a high-level breakdown of how we currently allocate our funds and the potential enhancements we can achieve with the grant:




Monthly Incentives (Current)
: Our current budget reserves $35,000 per month for our own token incentives for liquidity. This has resulted in an impressive average monthly average volume of $55+ million, leading to the generation of about $60,000+ in real yield (fees and bribes), which we redistribute in real yield to our token. The outcome is a marginal net inflation only.


Monthly Incentives (With Grant)
: The proposed grant of 240,000 ARB (~$200,000) allows us to substantially boost our monthly incentives to a total of $135,000 ($100,000 additional each month to the current $35,000 incentives). We expect this increase in incentives to spark exponential growth in both volume and Total Value Locked (TVL) on chain. This is straight incentives, but since we expect a major boost in liquidity the incentives from our side will increase as well and we aim to boost them to $50k that means $150k liquidity incentives each month ($100k from Grant + $50k from us in our token).


Impact on Fee Generation and Real Yield Redistribution
: The additional funding would enable us to double our fee generation and redistribution to our token holders because of volume growth. This not only enhances incentives but also fosters our token’s appreciation, subsequently elevating the APR which in turn into more incentives creating a loop. Hence, the current $35,000 in incentives will grow to over $50,000 due to the volume & liquidity influx, thereby increasing revenue and real yield, thus providing space for more incentives as explained in above point with projections.


Liquidity and Volume Projections
: Leveraging our existing efficiency ratio over the past months of 1.85 (Efficiency = Volume/Liquidity), we anticipate that a 3-4x increase in liquidity would lead to a 5x-6x surge in volume over our monthly average, approximately $100 million/month, facilitated by ~$135,000 ($100,000 from the grant and $35,000 from our Arbidex incentives) incentives to liquidity. This sets a solid ground for us to target our ambitious $1 billion mark in cumulative volume, indicating a potential volume increase of $700 million over the subsequent two months with the help of grant.




In essence, this grant is not just additional funding; it’s an essential catalyst that can supercharge the ecosystem, notably by enhancing incentives for liquidity providers and by allowing us to offer more to our holders through increased 100% fee redistributions resulting from the volume increase which allows us increase incentives which means that grant is not just a certain boost here but it starts a cycle which then can increase our incentives to 2.5x-3x or more. This grant is poised to significantly expedite the swift and efficient expansion of our platform on Arbitrum and bring significant tvl and volume on chain.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that we’re tracking for this milestone are Cumulative Trading Volume, Incentives, Real Yield Distributed, Total Value Locked. Each of these offers a unique perspective into our operations, guiding us to refine our strategies for the most efficient outcomes.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
: Our request for this grant is rooted in the genuine aim of bolstering the liquidity provision on Arbidex, our decentralized exchange (DEX) and Arbitrum as a blockchain. We believe that with the support from the Arbitrum Foundation, we can significantly strengthen the inherent “Liquidity Loop Flywheel” model, an approach that has proven instrumental in fostering a self-sustaining ecosystem within the DEX. The grant would act as a catalyst and eventually grow liquidity/tvl on Arbitrum. Arbidex is a closed community-to-community dex, where the incentives and fees all of it is redirected back to the users/investors hence no intermediaries.


To elaborate, the funds from the grant will solely be channeled towards incentivizing liquidity provision especially to BTC/ETH/ARB/USDC/USDT pools which have the most capital in all of DEFI. This infusion of liquidity is designed to drive a substantial increase in trading volume because. When there is deeper liquidity in our DEX attracted by incentives, traders are more likely to experience smooth, efficient, and favorable trades powered by our low tick spacing concentrated liquidity and 20% lower fees then other DEXES on chains like Optimism, Ethereum, BSC, Fantom and others, which might not be a big cut for small defi users but a good number and reason for Big Whale’s/Institution to move money to Arbitrum and trade on Arbidex saving the cut in fees and better rates. This enhanced trading experience invariably attracts more activity and, thus, raises the volume of transactions happening on Arbitrum and Arbidex. Meaning: Capital infusion from traders as well as yield farmers on Arbitrum for better yield and rates.


Higher transaction volume translates into more fees being generated for Arbidex. All of these fees, coupled with bribes from our partners, are redirected towards real yield staking for $ARX (our main utility token). The purpose of this redirection of all of fees + bribes is two-fold: on one hand, it appreciates the token value as the APRs for real yield staking increase; on the other hand, it incentivizes more users to contribute liquidity to our platform on Arbitrum, due to the higher returns from the farms as the token value appreciate.


This dynamic creates a powerful, virtuous cycle: as liquidity increases, trading volume and fees grow, fueling further yield for real yield stakers and incentivizing more liquidity provision, which in turn boosts liquidity yet again benefiting the chain as well as the dex as it is plays the key role.


We see this grant as an contribution not just in Arbidex, but in the future growth and robustness of the Arbitrum blockchain itself. By improving the liquidity, efficiency and lowering fees for swaps of our DEX, we are also enhancing the overall user experience and utility of the Arbitrum blockchain over every other blockchain. In essence, this grant serves to fortify the interconnected and mutually beneficial relationship between Arbidex and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.


Arbidex serves as a beacon of sustainable value in the Arbitrum ecosystem, fostering an environment where value isn’t minted but organically generated through a self-sustaining, 100% community-owned model without any intermediaries. This unique construct helps us enrich Arbitrum in several ways, each adding a distinct and enduring value. Arbidex has built a complete “circle of life” model where value is organically generated, focusing on “The People” where the true value lies.




Firstly, we offer 20% lower swap fees on swaps compared to DEXs on other chains such as Ethereum, BSC, Optimism, Fantom among others and even within Arbitrum as well. This competitive pricing drives significant volume to our platform and to Arbitrum, attracting a wider user base especially the bigger investors where this 20% cut matters.


Secondly, we have launched the Developer Program by Arbidex, a unique initiative that gives up to 25% of swap fees generated by the protocol’s token back to its treasury in real liquid token. This supports the growth and evolution of both emerging and established protocols by providing them with an additional revenue source for expanding there operations.


Lastly, Arbidex has partnered with various protocols to expand their offerings to the Arbitrum network for the time and also introduced them to the era of Concentrated Liquidity for the first time on Arbitrum only, which offers better swap rates than regular DEXs on other chains. For instance, our partnership with Frax Finance has introduced their $sfrxETH to the Arbitrum network, bringing the highest yield liquidity staking derivative (LSD) to Arbitrum from Mainnet and BSC. This successful introduction has seen millions of dollar worth of sfrxETH bridged to Arbitrum from the mainnet, and multiple partner protocols, including Frax Finance, have been introduced to Concentrated Liquidity on Arbitrum for the first time as well which drives a lot of volume from other chains because of better pricing with decent liquidity only.




In summary, Arbidex has facilitated a swap volume of about $300m on the Arbitrum network, reflecting our efficient model’s effectiveness. Furthermore, we have redistributed around $500k to our users as real yield, creating a self-perpetuating cycle that benefits our users and enhances the Arbitrum ecosystem’s vibrancy. As we continue to innovate, partner, and grow, we reaffirm our commitment to adding lasting value to the Arbitrum ecosystem, one swap at a time.


Justification for the size of the grant
: Our existing efficiency ratio over the past 6 months has been 1.85 (Efficiency = Volume/Liquidity) with current incentives, we anticipate that boosting incentives 3x-4x will result in a 3-4x increase in liquidity which would lead to a 5x-6x surge in volume over our monthly average, approximately $100 million/month, facilitated by ~$135,000 incentives to liquidity.


With previous data, average volume of $100m/month nets $62k in sole fees which is re-distributed to token which will be a 2x-2.5x increase in Real Yield resulting in token value appreciation resulting in higher aprs on farms.

SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Provide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?
: Yes, Arbidex is native to Arbitrum Network only.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?
: N/A


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?
: 03/15/2023


Protocol Performance
: We’re proud to share that Arbidex has performed remarkably well. The metrics reflect not only our dedicated efforts but also the value our platform offers to its people. And with little boost (grant) we can assure to reach new heights and levels.




Transaction Volume: We’ve recorded an impressive total ~$340 million in transaction volume so far, with daily averages consistently maintaining around the $2 million. On peak days, this figure has touched $8-10 million, evidencing the robust user engagement our platform has and the efficiency it offers at lowest fees.


Real Yield: Thanks to our community-first model, we’ve distributed roughly $500k back to the users staking ARX as real yield. This encompasses all sources of revenue, including fees, partner bribes, and other income streams.


Market Cap to Liquidity Ratio: Among native DEXs, we’ve maintained the thickest liquidity and the lowest Market Cap/Liquidity ratio, which usually stands between 1.2-1.7. This optimal ratio has not only ensured a dense liquidity pool but also fostered a stable token price with a relatively low market cap and deep liquidity.


Total Value Locked: Arbidex reached one of the highest tvl on Arbitrum on inception driving a lot of volume and capital on chain, with peak tvl of over ~$180m.


Real Yield APR: The average APR for real yield on our stakers has been an impressive 120-200% APR over the last five months at an average that would net to an 70% ROI so far in sole real yield i.e. BTC ETH ARB USDC. This figure is testament to the value we provide to our users, who benefit from 100% of the swap fees and partner bribes going to them.


Emissions: Currently, our effective daily emissions are only around ~$1k, while the fees generated range between $1.5k-$2k each day (daily average based on last 6 months). This closes us to one of the lowest inflation rates in the Arbitrum ecosystem in terms of incentives.


Efficiency: In terms of TVL to Volume efficiency, Arbidex stands out, regularly utilizing more than 60-70% of the DEX’s liquidity. On certain days, we’ve even reached 150% efficiency, an indicator of how well we optimize liquidity. Thanks to concentrated liquidity and the 20% lower fees.




In essence, these figures reflect the compelling performance of Arbidex, its ability to maintain stability while generating substantial real yield, and its success in fostering an efficient, low-inflation, and high-liquidity platform that benefits all users. Our vibrant growth and commitment to providing exceptional value make Arbidex a key central player in the Arbitrum ecosystem and with the grant many new heights can be reached.

: [Provide details]




We created Quest Protocol because we believe that decentralized protocols need decentralized growth tools to attract and engage users. Current solutions like Airdrops are great for building hype, but don’t provide an incentive to keep transacting on protocols once the airdrop occurs. Quest Protocol solves this by making it easy for anyone to deploy tokens for a specific onchain action, while using allowlists to limit sybil activity.


This grant will create the opportunity to bootstrap 
RabbitHole’s Arbitrum Quest Gateway
 with a proper token distribution program that anyone in the community to use, including future ARB grant recipients. We imagine that most community members will use this platform to kickstart growth when they launch and target new users rather than whales.


We plan on deploying quests to incentivize specific actions +25/-25% the price of gas cost, ensuring that we can grow the number of new users, engaging existing ones, and re-activating dormant ones. When Quest Protocol grows, projects in the Arbitrum ecosystem grow alongside it and reap the benefits.


We will deploy quests to the Quest Protocol for the following projects with the following allowlist strategies:

Justification for the size of the grant
: [Enter explanation]




We received a grant from Optimism of 250k OP and were able to drive 520,000+ quest completions (1 action on a third party protocol = 1 quest completion) and we have potential to do much higher volume at this efficiency.


We’re a neutral multi-chain protocol with the goal of growing overall Ethereum L2 usage and crypto in general. We view Arbitrum as one of the key players in our onchain future.


With this grant we look forward to driving smart and sustainable growth for Arbitrum.


Our distribution & quest completions are at all-time highs. Now is a great time to build out the quest ecosystem within Arbitrum. Please see below for additional metrics from our official dune dashboard and OP Grant Analysis.

How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
 :




ALAYA has a community of more than 100K users in many countries and regions, and a certain amount of incentive plans could effectively increase user activity. At the same time, ALAYA’s built-in friend referral reward function, which actively expands the user relationship network, will bring a large number of new users to the platform to a large extent.


ALAYA has a wealth of influencers, for specific influencers to develop exclusive promotional programs, could be more efficient to get new users. At the same time, ALAYA is also developing more influencer networks.


In order to increase user activity and participation in the project, Alaya has set up a gamified product experience to help out-of-web3 users to Web3 smoothly. With the promotion of ALAYA, users will hold their NFTs and keep training and upgrading their NFTs to get a higher level of product experience.


Relying on the theory of group intelligence, Alaya will continuously update and iterate the product. ALAYA has a complete set of user incentives, the built-in recommendation system can assign users to different modules to deal with the task, and will also motivate users to give their opinions on the product, and regularly optimize the product based on valid opinions. The built-in recommendation system can assign users to different modules to deal with the task, and will also motivate users to give their opinions on the product, and regularly optimize the product based on valid opinions.




Justification for the size of the grant
 :


Since the launch of ALAYA, driven by a series of go-to-market activities, amount of ALAYA’s users had a lot of growth, with the total number of users exceeding 150K. At the same time, the daily activity of the users and the interaction behavior on the chain has also been greatly improved.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size: 1,000,000 ARB


Grant Matching: N/A


Grant Breakdown:


The following is the liquidity mining program we plan to use to incentivize TVL growth using the granted ARB:




Users can stake deposited USDC, ETH, WBTC, ARB, and LINK for oARB emissions.


oARB is continuously emitted and can be vested on a first-come, first-serve basis.



We will use a simple MasterChef or Gauge contract for the emissions






oARB that’s emitted can be staked for x duration (in increments of 1 week up to 4 weeks) and must be paired with the same amount of ARB



For example, vesting 100 oARB requires you pair it with 100 ARB in the contract


We’ll represent each stake a user takes as unique NFT locks so popular DeFi dashboards can track them






oARB can only be staked if you’re a level 3 Dolomite user
 - So far we’ve received feedback that users do not want this to be a requirement. I’ll ask for more thoughts below.



The level is subject to change and may be level 4 depending on XP inflation between now and the start of the campaign


This ensures users that are farming aren’t just depositing the capital lazily



They must use the platform and familiarize themselves with its unique features






Reaching level 3 requires 60 XP, which can be achieved within 1 to 2 days if expedited by completing the following 
Achievements
:



Rock Climbing 101


Zap your GLP!


Zap your ETH!


MIM Launch Campaign


PT-GLP Launch Campaign


jUSDC Launch Campaign


Or others as we add more Special and Milestone achievements






Learn more about Dolomite XP 
here
 and its role in aligning users’ interests in Dolomite


We will use Chainlink Functions to make the API request to our Discord Bot to write the user’s current level on-chain.






After staking is done you can purchase the ARB for a y% discount using ETH


The discount will depend on how long you lock oARB for.



1-week is a 2.5% discount


2-weeks is 5% discount


3-weeks is 10% discount


4-weeks is 20% discount


As demonstrated with this discount schedule, staking to achieve the max discount requires users hold the paired ARB for longer






The price will be determined via Chainlink oracle at the time of purchase



This guarantees fair pricing and that farmers will make money when they execute the options


Keep in mind, oARB must be paired with ARB on a 1:1 basis to begin vesting. This will should help offset ARB sell pressure and constrain users from vesting oARB too quickly if they accumulate a large amount (similar to esGMX and GMX vesting)






If the ARB rewards pool is depleted, all remaining oARB tokens expire worthless


Staked ARB (that’s paired with oARB) will be deposited in Dolomite to boost liquidity and TVL


We want to avoid giving the tokens away for free since it encourages dumping at the expense of ARB in exchange for Dolomite’s TVL


Users will receive their exercised oARB as ARB tokens in their Dolomite Balance


How lucrative is this for farmers?



Suppose we emit $333k worth of ARB over 2 months ($2M annualized). The max discount is 20%, which means $400k worth of annualized value is emitted


If Dolomite gets $10M in TVL to stake, the max reward APR would be 4% - why?



$2M annualized * 20% discount = $400k in value received from farmers


$400k / $10M = 4%






Note: this program will be even more lucrative when staked deposits are lower, encouraging more yield farmers to participate








Note, we have also applied for a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation but we have not heard any details yet on the status of the application. The use of funds from the Foundation’s grant are different; they revolve around paying for more audits and team expansion, which will enable us to complete more integrations & add more robust features to Dolomite. These integrations will further connect the Arbitrum ecosystem through Dolomite and prompt further utilization of borrowable assets.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives: Our plan is to use the ARB to increase TVL on Dolomite so we can underwrite loans for larger positions. We’ve frequently brushed up against liquidity caps on Dolomite and have grown to $7M - $8M in TVL without any use of incentives to drive TVL. We think carefully using ARB to achieve this goal will enable a more positive UX on Dolomite for users to perform more complex looping and hedging strategies. If we can reach $15M in TVL, we can cement our position as the third largest lending protocol on Arbitrum. This would be an extremely positive signal for Dolomite’s growth in this choppy market and further showcase alignment with the Arbitrum ecosystem.


1600×673 180 KB




A screenshot of the top 15 lending protocols on Arbitrum as of 9/21. The TVL figures include Borrows.




Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): We will measure TVL, number of unique addresses farming, average duration used to vest oARB to ARB and retained liquidity after each campaign finishes.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


Arbitrum’s DeFi ecosystem has been wildly successful so far because of the high level of innovation that key projects delivered. Current lending protocols eliminate this innovation by restricting what you can do with your assets when you use them as collateral for a loan. Just scratching the surface of DeFi native rights stripped away by other lending protocols include voting with ARB, claiming & compounding GLP rewards, staking your plvGLP, vesting your old esGMX into GMX using your GLP. Dolomite removes this roadblock and allows the innovation and uniqueness of Arbitrum to flourish, while enabling important financial primitives for these DeFi native assets.


What does this mean in reality? Dolomite is the only lending protocol that lets users execute full account transfers for GLP into Dolomite, allowing users to transfer their esGMX rewards into Dolomite without skipping a beat. They can claim & compound their GLP rewards as if they were on the GMX web app. They can vest their esGMX into GMX using staked-GMX or using GLP. They can even vest their esGMX while their GLP is being used in an infinite number of isolated borrow positions. These examples can be extended to other assets Dolomite has listed that have DeFi native functionalities, like plvGLP and YT-GLP. When we release limit orders and other advanced portfolio management features, users can do all of these native DeFi actions while they have limit orders set or want to TWAP into a larger position. The possibilities are endless thanks to Dolomite’s modularized architecture, virtual liquidity system and broad token support.


Dolomite is currently the most composable lending protocol in all of DeFi. This paves the way for Dolomite to connect to every major Arbitrum project, making us a hub to list their assets and dramatically increase their network effects when their assets are integrated into Dolomite’s growing list of portfolio management features.


Justification for the size of the grant: Current reward APRs tend to hover around 1% - 5% for various protocols that use incentives. Considering our target is to achieve $10M in deposits for borrowable assets, like USDC, ETH, WBTC, LINK, etc., our proposed liquidity mining program will net users 4% APR assuming $10M in deposits and $400,000 in annualized returns for those deposits. Note, this does not include any additional costs incurred to purchase ARB tokens for pairing with oARB.


Execution Strategy: [Describe the plan for executing including resources, products, use of funds, and risk management. This includes allocations for specific pools, eligible assets, products, etc.] We plan to incentivize deposits of Dolomite’s core borrowable assets, like USDC, ETH, WBTC, ARB, and LINK. These assets will likely be in high demand once we list GMX V2’s GM Pools on Dolomite and Umami’s Vaults. Even during these non-volatile market conditions, they’re producing steady yields of 7%+ as shown below:


1242×532 62.6 KB


We plan to initially weigh the token incentives similar to the weights seen in GLP:




40% to USDC


25% to ETH


25% to WBTC


7% to ARB


3% to LINK




As we discover what yields entice users enough to increase deposits for each asset, we can tweak the weights to optimize where deposits are needed most.


Grant Timeline: Depending on when the grant application is accepted, we will need to finish creating the mechanics for the liquidity mining program. Once the contracts are deployed we will share the verified addresses on Arbiscan in the forum post. The DAO will remit the first tranche of funds and the Dolomite team will initialize liquidity mining for the first 8-week campaign.


If this proposal is greater than 1M ARB, please provide details on any funding tranches or milestones your application aims to abide by:


Funding Tranches: We’d like to do 3 funding tranches. Each campaign will be separated into 8 weeks of emissions to measure success of the campaign and its effectiveness to increase TVL and retain users.


Milestone Descriptions: We’d like to measure retained TVL on Dolomite, growth of TVL during the campaign, and unique wallets before and after the campaign. All of these metrics are easily captured using our 
Subgraph
. Our hope is that each campaign will raise TVL by approximately $3M until we net approximately $10M in total TVL growth. However, market conditions may curtail this growth, so we may also compare our growth relative to other lending protocols on Arbitrum throughout the time period.


SECTION 5: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Provide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?: Yes


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?: None as of now.


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?: October 3, 2022 (
deployment transaction
).


Protocol Performance: We’ve organically grown to ~$7M - $8M in TVL, $2M+ borrowed and have over 6,000 unique wallets that have used Dolomite. We’re trying to drive as much utility through Dolomite as possible through high-value integrations and creating useful features like our most-recent 
Zap release. We closed a $2.5M 
seed round
 in May of 2023 that had noteworthy participants such as Draper Goren Holm, NGC Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, WWVentures, and 6th Man Ventures, among others. We’ve been able to highlight the strength of Dolomite’s architecture through a few key listings that required us to overcome several technical complexities, such as GLP, YT-GLP, and jUSDC. To our team, shipping continuously and giving the community the sense that Dolomite is an active project is the most important value to uphold. Our users are our motivation and delivering value to them is a tremendous high.


You can see our stats at 
Dolomite
 and see our 
Subgraph
 for querying more raw data. We also have a 
Dune Dashboard
 created by a prominent community member, 
Shogun
 (please note some data may be inaccurate and we’re working with him to fix any issues that we identify).


Protocol Roadmap: Our roadmap is generally split into 2 distinct areas: listings/integrations and new product features.


In terms of new listings, we plan on integrating with GMX V2, Camelot’s spNFTs, more of Pendle’s tokens, Umami’s deconstructed GLP Vaults, and more. There are some noteworthy aspects to a few of these listings that are worth mentioning.


GMX’s GM tokens are much more difficult to underwrite compared to GLP because of the asynchronous nature of the minting and redemption of the assets. Dolomite is uniquely positioned to integrate with this asset and boast the strengths of its modular architecture.


Camelot is a project we haven’t done enough with yet, but we think there is a lot of novelty in underwriting spNFTs (users can continue to earn boosted yield while borrowing against these assets!). Camelot’s status of being an Arbitrum-native DeFi protocol will continue to signal Dolomite’s alignment with the ecosystem. It will also help us expand beyond the GMX ecosystem and GLP.


Feature-wise, we plan on adding:


Limit orders and transforming Dolomite into a cross-margin portfolio management protocol - We think the addition of “real” limit orders (that is, limit orders that exist as on-chain liquidity, as opposed to limit orders that execute as market orders) will pave the way for Dolomite to become more of a portfolio management tool. Users will be able to create limit orders to take profit on trades or pieces of their positions, enter borrow positions, or rebalance their borrow positions. Moreover, it’ll unlock more usefulness on our Trade page which has not been our focus lately, while we’ve been fleshing out the Borrow page. We plan on expanding Dolomite’s capabilities to offer new primitives like pair trading (although technically our Borrow page already supports this in a less structured way), rebalancing active cross-margin loans, and much more. These features are quite gas intensive and require fast confirmation times to offer a strong UX - both features that Arbitrum will help us offer with ease. Lastly, limit orders will serve as another stepping stone for us to eventually add even more advanced order types that can be used across borrow positions and margin trades, like stops, TWAP, VWAP, etc.


Chainlink Automation for creating safer oracles for ERC4626 Vault tokens - Security is paramount to creating trust around a new lending protocol. We think the recent exploits throughout this bear market have marred the average user’s appetite to try some of these newer protocols and people are looking to see how some of these problems are being tackled. One of the most common exploit vectors with listing LP/Vault tokens is manipulating the price via donation or read-only reentrancy to manipulate the token’s oracle - we saw this with several other protocols. We’re developing a solution using 
Chainlink Automation
 to solve this problem by using Chainlink nodes to cache this data in a context that’s separate from lending operation - and are creating a smart contract system for Automation that functions similar to how their oracles operate (using a heartbeat and deviation threshold). Through our participation in 
Chainlink’s BUILD
 program, we will push this narrative and boast this new solution to such an important problem. This will reflect nicely on the Arbitrum ecosystem for fostering a secure and innovative DeFi environment.


This was 
announced
 on September 20, 2023 (we wrote this proposal prior to releasing the feature)!


Audit History: Dolomite’s codebase has undergone 5 audits throughout its lifetime. The core protocol is immutable and cannot be changed (this helps make the dev UX consistent and prevent bugs from being introduced later on). All deployed smart contracts have 100% line, statement, and branch coverage. Prior to deployment, all tests are run against a shadow fork of Arbitrum mainnet and are extensively QA tested. Dolomite also publishes all admin transactions that affect the protocol in the docs in the 
Admin Transactions
 section. Dolomite is actively monitored by 
Chainalysis CIR
 to offer early detection and rapid response to any potential exploit. Lastly, we completed an integration with 
Risk Harbor
 to offer depositors insurance on their funds which will launch soon. You can read more about Dolomite’s security & audit history

SECTION 6: Data and Reporting


Provide details on how your team is equipped to provide data and reporting on grant distribution.


Is your team prepared to create Dune Spells and/or Dashboards for your incentive program?: Yes, we can add it to our existing

Requested Grant Size: Siren Grants - 750,000 ARB


Grant Matching:


Wombat will be providing our usual incentives for ARB partnership pools and on ARB cross-chain pools (to facilitate cross-chain features to ARB), the grant is NOT used towards usual running of Wombat. This grant will be used to provide additional incentive towards Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan with the goal to increase liquidity, capital efficiency and in turn, trading volume, on Wombat ARB (including Wombat ARB Cross-Chain from other chains into ARB via our capital efficient cross-chain ARB swap/pool) to further drive growth to Wombat ARB including in the ARB cross-chain ecosystem. The grant will also be used towards Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan liquidity rush/boosting programs with our ARB partners (existing and new) to push the liquidity to a new height, and in turn, growth of adoption of innovative DeFi features on ARB (such as working with lending borrowing protocols, yield aggregators, and so on on top of Wombat LPs). This grant is NOT used towards the regular running of Wombat ARB or any other chain/network activities.


Wombat has also been paying and will continue to pay for all the regular business and marketing of Wombat on ARB during Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan, including our Wombat Arbitrum partnership pools’ emissions.


Grant Breakdown:


All of the grants will be used towards Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan which includes incentivizing liquidity provision on Wombat ARB and Wombat ARB cross-chain and, in turn, driving new growth of capital efficiency, trading volume and incentivizing other DeFi protocols to open pools and build upon Wombat ARB. This includes Wombat Arbitrum Cross-Chain Expansion Plan to further grow our ARB cross-chain pools to increase the efficiency of tokens seamlessly bridging and swapping into Arbitrum via Wombat cross-chain pools in the hyper-capital efficient manner.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives:


Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan :






Further Increase Arbitrum DeFi TVL - Through additional support from this grant into our Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan, Wombat will bring in additional liquidity from the other chains that we support (directly or through our ecosystem projects and partners) such as from BNB Chain and Ethereum, and in turn, further increasing Arbitrum DeFi TVL, especially with our cross-chain ARB pool, seamlessly bridging other chains’ token into ARB in the hyper-capital-efficient manner.






Further Increase Arbitrum DeFi users - Through additional support from this grant into our Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan, Wombat will bring in more users, ecosystem projects, and partners from BNB Chain, Ethereum to ARB, increasing ARB DeFi users, especially with our cross-chain ARB pool.






Further Improve Capital Efficiency for ARB Stablecoins and LSDs Holders - Through additional support from this grant into our Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan, Wombat will continue to improve and upgrade our proprietary and innovative full-range concentrated liquidity algorithm, which is not only cross-chain now and also hyper-efficient (being consistently picked up by aggregators as one of the best choices in terms of slippage, price, speed, and gas for even sizable transactions and especially during time of volatility) maintaining, improving, and further growing simple hyper-capital-efficiency on ARB. We are consistently ranked very competitively in terms of trading volume even with much less TVL compared to our competitors. We aim for capital efficiency! Example: 
588×575 123 KB


Source: Wombat Exchange Twitter sharing Defillama rankings






Simplifies Concentrated Cross-Chain Liquidity for ARB Liquidity Providers - Through additional support from this grant into our Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan, we will further grow adoption of our innovative single token staking design which simplifies the liquidity provision process for Wombat ARB liquidity providers. It minimizes the impermanent loss effect for LPs, which is also implemented on our cross-chain ARB pools. This also simplifies the process for other DeFi protocols to build upon Wombat ARB.






Simplifies cross-chain swapping for ARB DeFi users - Through additional support from this grant into our Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan, we will further grow adoption of our innovative cross-chain swapping ARB pool allows one-step cross-chain swapping of different pegged assets, simplifying the cross-chain swapping experience for ARB DeFi users and other chains’ users wanting to swap into ARB.






Through additional support from this grant into our Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan, we will grow the interoperability with other DeFi protocols on ARB, improving the efficiency of the ARB DeFi ecosystem as a whole.






Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):


Wombat will begin distributing the incentives as soon as the tokens are received in the multisig. This will commence the first epoch (one-week period), with the mentioned goals, objectives and relevant data which will be shared on an ongoing basis in-line with the timing of the following epoch token distributions to Wombat.


The distribution of incentives will be executed as per the allocation breakdown document on an epoch basis, and will continue for the 3 month period of the framework (At the latest up until January 31st 2024).


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?


Stablecoins are essential for the growth of the ARB DeFi ecosystem, and LSDs are gaining more traction every day, being one of the few products with actual and stable yield in DeFi. These pegged assets form the top projects of DeFi and remain part of the backbone of DeFi. Wombat’s proprietary and innovative hyper-capital-efficient algorithm maximizes liquidity for these pegged assets in the ARB ecosystem. It is especially beneficial for the many new DeFi stablecoin and LSD projects to kick-start their liquidity flywheel and growth. For ARB DeFi consumers, Wombat ARB offers swaps with competitive (if not the best) price, slippage, gas, and speed (relevant to TVL) for them to get more every time they swap between these pegged assets, increasing the whole ARB DeFi ecosystem’s capital efficiency. Our track record of doing more trading volume than our competitors with higher TVL proves this, which is an essential feature for the future of AMM, being about capital efficiency. Our innovative single-token-staking process simplifies the onboarding process for liquidity providers, especially new liquidity providers, without having to deal with staking in pairs, helping to onboard new liquidity providers to the ARB DeFi ecosystem.


With this grant supporting our Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan , we can further grow our stableswap on ARB by increasing our liquidity, capital efficiency, trading volume and collaboration with other DeFi protocols. For example, RedStone Oracle is integrating with Wombat ARB. The ARB price feed is expected to go live soon, facilitating the utility of Wombat-LP towards protocols such as lending and borrowing as collaterals. On top of growth of liquidity and capital efficiency on ARB, we will use the grant to further incentivize innovative collaboration/building of new features with other DeFi projects, with the incentives ultimately going to ARB users.


In addition, and most importantly, Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan  with the support of this grant, with further grow liquidity of our ARB cross-chain pools, Wombat will bring in more users and volume through our community, ecosystem projects, and partners from BNB Chain, ETH, primarily through our cross-chain ARB pool, increasing users and TVL of ARB DeFi ecosystem as a whole.


Justification for the size of the grant:


The stability and utilities of stablecoins and LSDs render these pegged assets part of the backbone of DeFi for all blockchains, including ARB. Wombat is a hyper-capital-efficient multi-chain swap for stablecoins and LSDs. Our proprietary and innovative full-range concentrated liquidity algorithm and single-asset-staking design offer unmarked capital efficiency, speed, and simplicity for swapping and staking stablecoins and LSDs. We wish to bring these products, with proven track records on BNB Chain, Arbitrum, and Ethereum, to the next level on ARB,  through the support of this grant into our Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan.


Our new ARB cross-chain pool (powered and supported by Wormhole) has been released and proven to have one of the most seamless cross-chain + swap experiences, as it is easy to use and, most importantly, fast. We are excited to further grow the liquidity and adoption of these pools to bring in more users, ecosystem projects, and communities from other chains Wombat supports and connect them with the Arbitrum ecosystem.


This grant will help us with our Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan to onboard more users, communities, and ecosystem projects from multiple chains to Wombat ARB, as well as maximize the liquidity, volume and adoption of our hyper-capital-efficient swap, which Wombat brought and will continue to upgrade to and on ARB for ARB users, ecosystem and community. The goal is for Wombat ARB to further grow and increase sticky ARB DeFi TVL, increase ARB DeFi user numbers, improve capital efficiency for ARB stablecoin and LSD holders, simplify liquidity provision for ARB liquidity providers as well as simplify the cross-chain onboarding process for users from other chains wanting to try ARB. More importantly, we want to bring with us our ecosystem partners from other chains, as well as add value to other ARB DeFi ecosystem projects as a hyper-capital-efficient swap and a stable yield-bearing protocol that is easy to integrate with minimal effort.


The grant will go towards user acquisition incentives, more specifically liquidity provider incentives, for our Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan as well as for every Arbitrum product we create subsequently, either by Wombat or together with our ecosystem partners who will also be coming to ARB with us from BNB Chain, and Ethereum (such as Wombex, Magpie and Quoll). We have finished the integrations with aggregators such as 1inch, Odos, and Openocean to Wombat ARB on this front. We are actively working with other aggregation partners.


In addition, this Arbitrum grant will also further encourage third-party integrations onto Wombat on Arbitrum, either with native Arbitrum projects or with our existing partners and friends from BNB Chain and Ethereum coming to ARB. We are already actively working with other DeFi legos, such as our recent partnership with RedStone Oracle, further increasing actual utilities of Wombat-LPs.


Wombat Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan  & ARB pool liquidity rush/boosting program launch plan:




Launch of Wombat’s cross-chain pool rush/boosting program on Arbitrum, with a marketing campaign (with incentives to try liquidity provisions, swaps, and social engagements funded by Wombat) with liquidity provision incentives (funded with the grant).


We inform the Wombat community and program users through Discord, Telegram, and Twitter.


The launch of Wombat’s  cross-chain pool rush/boosting program will work also to cover the next level growth of our smart router for our cross-chain pools with Wombat’s existing partners, such as Stader and Frax, and our ecosystem projects, such as Wombex, Magpie, and Quoll, with an entire launch marketing campaign (funded by Wombat or ecosystem projects) with liquidity provision incentives (LP incentives funded by the grant). Marketing campaigns will be conducted on all of Wombat’s socials, such as Twitter, Discord, Telegram, and most Arbitrum community channels. Medium articles and PR articles covering the launch will also be published amplifying the launch, such as social content/amplification competitions.


The launch of Wombat’s cross-chain pool rush/boosting program will also support and cover the next level growth of Wombat cross-chain ARB pools with an entire marketing campaign (funded by Wombat) and additional liquidity incentives (funded by the grant).


Wombat will also engage marketing platforms to further educate users (from new chains that we will support) into trying to provide liquidity and perform swaps on Wombat and cross-platforms from other chains into Wombat ARB, to educate new users to try Wombat ARB (funded by Wombat).




The Wombat’s  cross-chain pool rush/boosting program will incentivize ARB and Wombat community members from the BNB Chain and ETH to try out Wombat ARB cross-chain to further drive traction of Wombat ARB.


The 750K ARB would allow Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan to provide additional incentive (on top of Wombat’s usual protocol incentives) to attract stablecoin and LSD token holders to use Wombat ARB cross-chain (especially from other chains via our innovative cross-chain ARB swap) to further grow and further build up reputation of Wombat ARB in the DeFi ecosystem during the launch of the Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan, which is essential to further scale Wombat ARB and further grow Wombat ARB cross-chain and stabilize ARB cross-chain pool’ growth. The amount is calculated using the initial budget of our previous successful launches on BNB Chain.


Execution Strategy: [Describe the plan for executing, including resources, products, use of funds, and risk management. This includes allocations for specific pools, eligible assets, products, etc.]


Wombat’s  cross-chain pool rush/boosting program launch plan:

Wombat takes out the complexity in hyper-capital-efficient concentrated liquidity provision and cross-chain, two of them together. We are targeting any DeFi users, including new users, to participate in this natural and sustainable yield journey. We provide focused liquidity in full range; hence, users would not have to worry about setting fields and actively managing their liquidity. The single-asset staking design also removes the complexity of staking in pairs, removing impermanent loss and the complexity of converting half of the staking token to make a pair before depositing.


Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan is targeting any existing ARB Mainnet users (who have not yet tried Wombat ARB) holding any amount of stablecoins or LSDs wanting to deposit and earn in a straightforward step. Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan  is also targeting stablecoins and LSDs holders from other chains that Wombat supports (and will support) to swap their stablecoins or LSDs to stables or LSDs on ARB Mainnet with a straightforward step without worrying about bridging and wrapping assets. Hence, we target all stablecoins and LSD holders on Arbitrum, BNB Chain (coming to ARB), and Ethereum (coming to ARB).


We are already discussing with all the existing Wombat ecosystem partners, including most of the top stablecoins and LSDs (already on ARB and the ones planning to come to ARB) regarding our Wombat’s  cross-chain pool rush/boosting program. We will also target the users of yield boosting, lending, and leverage protocols that leverage upon Wombat LPs by establishing partnerships with them to expand the reach of Wombat to their ecosystem members.


ARB Grant Distribution Plan

Milestone Descriptions: N/A


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Provide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:


No, however, we are a cross-chain protocol, which made Arbitrum our second deployment.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?:


BNB Chain, Ethereum Mainnet


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?:


April 5, 2023


Protocol Performance:


Wombat is one of the top ~10 protocols by transaction volume on arbitrum consistently, with a cumulative transaction volume of 315M just on Arbitrum since our launch. This is notably done with a lower TVL than competitors (demonstrating our capital efficiency and assistance we are able to offer to other DeFi projects on ARB, especially new projects, much less TVL needed for their liquidity needs), signifying our algorithm and design’s capital efficiency.


Protocol Roadmap:


Wombat is preparing for cross-chain expansion and will exist on 10+ chains in the coming 6 months targeting to bring volume from all these chains to ARB. We will have an algorithm upgrade in progress that will expand the capabilities of the Wombat AMM. We have an upgraded bribe contract which will simplify and expand the use-case for our partner projects. Furthermore, we are working with many borrowing and lending aggregators, yield boosters, LSDs, for more synergistic partnerships that will grow DeFi even more on Arbitrum


Expand Liquidity:


Our Wombat Arbitrum Expansion Plan focus will be on further growing our ARB cross-chain pools’ liquidity to bring in other chains’ users into ARB this way, further strengthening our presence in the ARB cross-chain ecosystem. Further, we will work with our existing partners on ARB in boosting their pools’ TVL and trading volume and continue adding new pools with other new partners on ARB onto Wombat ARB especially with our new cross-chain features combined into the same pool as swap. Further, we will further grow our stableswap liquidity on ARB by collaborating with other innovative DeFi protocols, ultimately growthing utility and efficiency of these liquidity. For example, RedStone Oracle is integrating with Wombat. The ARB price feed is expected to go live soon (if not already live), facilitating the utility of Wombat-LP towards protocols such as lending and borrowing as collaterals. We will use the grant to continue to further incentivize innovative collaboration/building of new features with other DeFi projects, with the incentives ultimately going to ARB users to increase the overall liquidity with our mega-capital efficient algorithm on ARB.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives
:


The main goal of Rysk is to create a decentralized options market that can flip the volumes of CEXs. We believe there is a significant opportunity to attract new options traders to the Arbitrum Ecosystem and increase trading volumes across the entire space. Therefore, the objective of the grant is to on-board new options traders into the Arbitrum ecosystem, accelerate Rysk’s growth and position Arbitrum as the primary chain to trade decentralized options. To achieve this, we propose distributing grants to the key participants in the Rysk ecosystem.


1. Traders

Traders are a critical component of the Rysk protocol since the DHV Revenue Potential is a function of 
Spread
 and 
Volume
 and the risk is a function of the Inventory Turnover. The higher the volumes and the inventory turnover the higher will be the profitability for the LPs.


For this reason, we are targeting traders to receive incentives based on their volumes and based on their trading impact to increase the DHV inventory turnover to reduce risk exposure of the pool.


2. Liquidity Providers

Liquidity is one of main drivers to increase volumes and trading activity to Rysk. Higher liquidity allows traders to make large sized trades with minimal slippage and narrow bid / ask spreads. In order to attract more liquidity and increase cumulative returns for depositors, grants will be distributed to Liquidity Providers based on their stake in the DHV. The target is to increase TVL and returns. Increasing TVL is critical to scale volumes, since DHV is currently at very high utilization (~60%-80% average utilization in September), and considering the incentives planned on the trading side it is safe to assume that higher TVL will be needed to support volume growth.


Below an analysis on the expected impact of the grants:


Screenshot 2023-10-05 at 00.17.37
1668×978 48.2 KB


We expect the TVL to go around $3m since this will generate an additional ~0.47% returns on a weekly basis (assuming current ARB/USD price). On the trading side the target is 3k contracts traded per week, that will distribute an incentive of ~$4.69 (assuming current ARB/USD price) per contract traded, an incentive strong enough to rebate fees and enter trades that reduce the risk exposure of the pool.

How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
:


Since the Beyond launch, Rysk has positioned itself as one of the top three options protocols by volumes. On average, since launch it accounts for over 5% of the total volumes in the space.

Rysk volumes are primarily driven by returning users who consistently trade with a low churn rate. Current Rysk traders commonly provide feedback that they all enjoy the Rysk trading experience.

The main challenge for Rysk at this stage is to increase awareness of Rysk and encourage user participation in the protocol. Grants could have a significant impact on achieving this goal for the following reasons:


1. Traders

Currently, one of the main challenges for Rysk is the low volatility environment, which makes options selling unattractive to traders. The DHV acts as a market maker, and maintaining a balanced flow between buyers and sellers is crucial for the success and sustainability of the protocol. Traders will receive incentives based on volumes and their impact in reducing the DHV book exposure to risky instruments that can cause losses for Liquidity Providers. By achieving a more balanced flow, the Rysk mechanism becomes healthier, benefiting the entire Arbitrum ecosystem with a liquid and sustainable on-chain options DEX.


In addition to Rysk Beyond DHV, the protocol is relatively new, and the goal of this grant is to increase the awareness of Rysk and attract new options traders. Arbitrum is currently the primary derivative chain, and we believe that options have significant growth potential. This grant will be used to position Rysk as one of the main options protocols and strengthen Arbitrum as the derivative chain.


2. Liquidity Providers

One of the current limitations of the Rysk protocol is the lack of liquidity. This is due to low TVL and low capital efficiency, resulting in limited trading volumes. To address this issue, the grants will be utilized to focus on increasing liquidity. Simultaneously, the team will continue researching and implementing optimizations to improve capital efficiency in order to be competitive with CEXs. Additionally, efforts will be made to improve options pricing and advance risk management.


Justification for the size of the grant
:


Rysk is an OG Arbitrum native. Rysk Alpha was launched in September 2022, over a year ago, and has not been deployed to other chains since then. Since the launch, we have also developed integrations to trade on-chain with other Arbitrum native protocols such as GMX and Rage Trade, and we are actively seeking to integrate with more protocols.


Rysk has always been highly active in the Arbitrum community. For example, we organized a trading competition in partnership with Gammaswap, an Arbitrum Native protocol. The competition was sponsored by various main Arbitrum protocols, including GMX, JonesDao, Dopex, Radiant, Across, Perennial, Mux, Factor, Rage Trade, Umami, and Vela, with the aim of engaging the entire community.


In addition, we believe that a decentralized options market with deep liquidity and high performance is critical in any financial system. Rysk is currently focused on providing a competitive, innovative, and composable options venue in the Arbitrum Ecosystem. This venue can be used by traders, sophisticated institutions, and other protocols to hedge, speculate, or build complex options strategies.


It is clear that the DeFi options market is a very challenging industry. This is due to the complexity of options by design, technical product limitations (such as capital requirements), and the current market conditions with low volatility. We are working hard to improve the protocol, educate users, and collaboratively build the entire DeFi options industry together with teams and communities in the space.


The growth potential of DeFi options is massive, especially if institutional players enter the space. Our final goal is to position Rysk and Arbitrum as the go-to place for trading options as DeFi matures and the options market takes off.


It’s worth noting that as of today, Rysk has never received a grant from Arbitrum or any other chain.


In conclusion, the grant size reflects Rysk’s status as an OG Arbitrum protocol, native to Arbitrum, integrated within its ecosystem with a collaborative approach. The grant size also considers the challenges of the DeFi options market, the potential for growth, and the significant impact that grants can have on expanding the options space. This grant aims to provide Rysk and Arbitrum with a competitive advantage.


Execution Strategy
:


Grants will be distribute as follow:


1. Traders

Rysk traders will be eligible on a weekly basis for a share of ARB as a function of the volumes traded and the impact of the trades to reduce the DHV exposure and risk.


The amount distributed per contract will be capped to avoid wash trading. The cap will be different on each trade and will be a function of bid-ask spread, fees, the exposure of the series, position held, the time the position is held and type of trade (sell or buy).


2. Liquidity Providers

Rysk DHV depositors will be eligible on a weekly basis for a share of ARB based on their capital proportion in the pool.


Grant Timeline
: Funds will be distributed until Jan 31st 2024 on a weekly basis, starting after the first stream is received.


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size
: 200k ARB


Grant Matching
: n/a


Grant Breakdown
:

The purpose of this grant is to incentivize growth of the DAO ecosystem on Arbitrum and Arbitrum Nova. Today, Tally supports over 500 DAOs with a collective TVL over $10 Billion. DAOs have moved over $100 Million via Tally proposals. The Arbitrum DAO itself is one of Tally’s power users, representing almost $4 Billion in TVL. However, outside of the Arbitrum DAO itself, the DAO ecosystem on Arbitrum is still nascent. Tally supports only 9 DAOs on Arbitrum and 0 on Arbitrum Nova. We believe a healthy onchain DAO ecosystem is one of the most important signals of ecosystem quality and staying power. The best projects in crypto are managed transparently via onchain governance, where no one entity or group controls the admin keys. Application leaders across Ethereum like Uniswap, ENS, and Compound use Tally because it’s the standard for operating onchain governance. Arbitrum is a DeFi rich environment, which would provide DAOs multiple ways to natively deploy a treasury leveraging the countless native protocols on Arbitrum. We believe incentivizing existing and new protocols on Arbitrum to deploy onchain governance and operate on Tally will drive sustainable growth in the ecosystem.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives
:


We intend to leverage the funds to drive adoption of onchain DAOs on Arbitrum. Tally is the industry standard application for onchain governance. We are already speaking with multiple protocols and dev teams who are interested in deploying their DAO on Tally or migrating their existing governance to Tally. We will use these funds to incentivize those teams to make Arbitrum their home.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
:


Number of DAOs deployed on Tally

TVL growth of Arbitrum DAOs on Tally

Amount of value transferred via Arbitrum DAOs on Tally


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
: We will directly use the grant to incentivize existing DAOs on Arbitrum to grow and to attract teams to operate their DAOs on Arbitrum. Governance is at the heart of any protocol. Growing DAO-managed assets on Arbitrum leads to protocol growth (the Arbitrum Short Team Incentive Program being a perfect example). We have an existing pipeline of customers who are planning to launch and/or grow their governance on Tally. We will deploy incentive funds directly into the governance contracts of those DAOs.


Justification for the size of the grant
: We plan to offer an average grant size of 10k ARB to incentivize ~20 protocols to grow their DAOs on Arbitrum. We will scale the grant size up or down depending on the TVL of the DAO. We will implement a minimum TVL and other requirements (must pass at least one proposal) before the grant is given out.


Execution Strategy and Timeline
: We plan to actively work with projects to grow and deploy on Arbitrum and anticipate being able to deploy the grant by Jan. 31, 2024. Execution will be a manual, careful, partnership-based process that involves working closely with projects to grow their existing governance contracts and deploy new governance contracts on Arbitrum.


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?
 Yes


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Provide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?
: Yes. We have long supported Arbitrum and Arbitrum Nova. The Arbitrum DAO is Tally’s most important client.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?
: The current list of networks Tally supports can be found here: 
Network Support - Tally Docs


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?
: August 25th, 2022


Protocol Performance
:




$10B of TVL in DAOs on Tally


$100M of value transferred via Tally proposals


500+ DAOs on Tally


5,000+ proposals passed on Tally




SECTION 5: Data and Reporting


Provide details on how your team is equipped to provide data and reporting on grant distribution.


Is your team prepared to create Dune Dashboards for your incentive program?
: Yes, we will create Dune dashboards that provide visibility into all the Arbitrum DAOs on Tally that received grants via the incentive program funds, including details such as TVL, proposals passed, delegates, and votes. We have experienced data engineers at Tally who can deliver on this reporting.


Does your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread?
 Yes


Does your team acknowledge that failure to comply with any of the above requests can result in the halting of the program’s funding stream?

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size:
 525,000 ARB


Grant Matching:
 2,500,000 veCHR


Chronos: The ARB Gateway (Chronos TAG)


Chronos TAG is a public infrastructure layer that will drive deeper liquidity for Arbitrum projects at the lowest possible cost. We have designed a bribe matching framework that uses ARB to match partner protocol bribes based on value provided to the liquidity hub (bribe value, liquidity deposited and veCHR locking). When compared to direct LP incentives, this is significantly more capital efficient as much more value is generated for each $ of incentive. Through multiplied voting incentives and increasing CHR scarcity, higher emissions will support higher TVL and deeper liquidity. Over the grant period Chronos TAG will be leveraged to achieve two objectives:




Direct support for Arbitrum native projects to achieve long-lasting network growth


Drive volume and liquidity for ecosystem ETH/ARB pairs through our hyper-efficient CLM




1. Deeper and cheaper liquidity through bribe matching – 250,000 ARB


Velodrome and pioneers like Curve and Convex have shown that bribe-for-emission models are a far more capital efficient way to drive liquidity. Although initially attractive, direct LP incentives are one of the 
least effective ways to drive network growth
. The most recent estimate is that the bribe matching programme on Velodrome is attracting $10 in bribes for every $1 in OP spent; an unequivocal success (
Velodrome Grant Performance Update - 
Monitoring - Optimism Collective
). This shows the value creation that ve(3,3) models can generate for users, partners and the entire network with such mechanisms. Through effective growth, we want to establish Arbitrum as the most attractive place for builders.


In this light, we will continue building products that can drive sustainable revenue for our partners and users. Chronos has a live low-cost, high volume CLM solution, a financial NFT (fNFT) marketplace and our upcoming derivatives exchange (ChronoX) will generate further revenue that will be distributed to attract new users to Arbitrum, strengthen LP returns and deepen ecosystem liquidity.


Under the conditions imposed here, protocols will be encouraged to remain on Chronos to maximise the value available to them. This is important as reducing the cost for protocols to attract liquidity enables partners to direct development resources elsewhere. As this is universal for all our partners, this increases the overall sustainability for new and the 35+ protocols that currently partner with Chronos. To this end we request the following:




Amount:
 250,000 ARB


Delivery:
 15,625 ARB per week for 16 weeks




All partners will have their bribes matched to certain percentages based on pool type and bribing performance:






Core CLM pools (30%):
 ETH and ARB CL pairs that drive benefit the most revenue and volume for the ecosystem.






Core partners: (20%):
 A partner pool that sustains an average bribe value of at least $2000 over 2 epochs






New Arbitrum native partners: (20%):
 New projects native to Arbitrum with less than 500k marketcap onboarded onto Chronos for less than 4 epochs






Foundation partners (10%):
 A partner pool that sustains an average bribe value of less than $2000 over 2 epochs






To help partners build protocol owned liquidity (POL), we will issue a bribe boost to partners who deposit POL on Chronos. Furthermore, to be a growth catalyst for new Arbitrum native projects (<500k marketcap) we will issue a bribe boost based on low POL to give native projects the best chance of succeeding.




10% Arbitrum Native Boost:
 Min $50,000 (volatile / stable)


10% Bribe Boost:
 Min $250,000 (volatile) or $500,000 (stable)


20% Bribe Boost:
 Min $500,000 (volatile) or $1,000,000 (stable)




Bringing in the next generation of Arbitrum protocols - 1,500,000 veCHR


Depending on the adoption of Chronos TAG we would deploy any outstanding ARB from the bi-weekly stream to bribe match newly onboarded low marketcap Arbitrum native partner pools up to a value of 40%. If there is no outstanding ARB, we have allocated 1,500,000 veCHR over the course of the grant period to achieve the target rate. By directing resources to the projects that need it most, this will give new Arbitrum native projects the best chance at succeeding at growing their liquidity and supports the next generation of applications.


2. Locking in growth potential for Arbitrum users and protocols – 75,000 ARB


Whilst the maximisation of bribe value brings protocols enhanced cost efficiency to grow liquidity by attracting emissions and increasing user revenue; the other side of the coin (namely accumulating veCHR) is needed to unlock the full capacity of the Chronos system. We want to provide a low-cost platform that allows protocols and users to gain governance power over platform emissions. 
As a DEX for the entire community
 we have set highly accessible barriers for entry.


A growing number of protocols and users making a long-term investment provides better alignment for the entire ecosystem. Furthermore, increased CHR scarcity has an important indirect effect of bolstering sustainable revenue for Arbitrum LPs.




Amount:
 75,000 ARB + 1,000,000 veCHR


Delivery:
 4,687 ARB per week for 16 weeks




Method:




Chronos will match any 2-year lock of liquid CHR worth $50-$99.99 to a value of 10% with veCHR


Wallets max locking $100+ of veCHR will proportionally share a pool of 4,687 ARB per epoch. Only 2-year locks of liquid CHR locks are eligible.


A bribe boost will be applied if protocols hit the listed lock milestones each week




TAG summary table
1600×991 98.2 KB


3. Deeper liquidity for ecosystem pools on a high volume CLM – 100,000 ARB


To drive deeper ecosystem liquidity, we will use ARB to bribe core ETH/ARB pools on our CLM. This will bring more volume and drive better price execution for Arbitrum.




Amount:
 100,000 ARB


Delivery:
 6250 ARB per week for 16 weeks split as follows:


25% to WETH/USDC.e


25% to WETH/USDT


25% to ARB/USDC.e


25% to ARB/USDT




We sampled different CL solutions on the network on three separate days during the grant period to see which pools were most able to capture useful volume on Arbitrum. This shows that the 
Chronos CLM is hyper-efficient
 and is a robust choice to use ARB to drive adoption, users and volume growth for the network.


Volume Efficiency
1058×425 70.5 KB


Any ARB that is redirected back to Chronos through treasury voting power will be automatically recycled into CLM pools. This will have a cumulative effect on bribes and therefore emissions and liquidity depth. Additionally, we will confirm this recycling in our bi-weekly report.


Chronos TAG Summary:


Partners could get up to 70% of their bribes matched in addition to the lock bonus. This will allow protocols to build liquidity in a sustainable way and has several benefits:




Provides a clear path for projects to increase ARB governance power


Supports bribing capacity that lowers liquidity costs


Protects ARB price and drives value derived from ARB


Protocols must bribe to benefit; defacto buy-in and real revenue is generated for users.


Targets benefits for new Arbitrum native protocols to gain TAG benefits to grow liquidity


Our proposal is fully costed and has used real data to achieve maximum impact at low cost




TAG Rules:




Bribe matching is performed on a first-come-first-serve basis


Partners must bribe, lock and deposit liquidity with the same address


Any whitelisted protocol will be eligible for TAG incentives


ARB is not eligible for matching


No single partner / user will receive >10% of total incentives over the grant period




Vetting




To support the best of the newest builders, Arbitrum native projects will be pre-vetted to ensure that the team has shown a commitment to auditing and providing immutable, permissionless and decentralised contracts.




Sustainable behaviour






New Arbitrum native projects with <$200,000 of liquidity on Arbitrum cannot bribe with their native token at more than 1% of their total POL each week.






Partners must recycle at least 50% of ARB they receive from voting






Should any protocol engage in negative sum behaviour, say consistently dumping ARB and farming emissions without locking and not recycling, we reserve the right to terminate any incentives.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


PART ONE: ChronoX - Brining in a new era for on-chain derivatives trading


We are requesting ARB to help us realise an ambitious and novel DeFi application. Due to the novel mechanism we provide a background for readers:


Description:
 ChronoX is a novel approach that takes the efficiency of an on-chain derivatives exchange to a new level. Currently, centralised exchanges (CEX) have a lot of liquidity but little security (see FTX), whilst on-chain decentralised exchanges have low liquidity but are secure and transparent. Through the automated markets for quotes (AMRFQ) framework, ChronoX will bring CEX liquidity on-chain in a trustless and completely secure way.


Current limitations:
 On-chain derivatives exchanges based on vAMM technology are significantly constrained in their capacity to be capital efficient by the need to reserve large amounts of liquidity for overcollateralisation. The cost of idle liquidity is further increased as when traders win the entire LP pool loses; thus extra risk must be priced in. The consequence of this is that liquidity becomes expensive as it is risky and inefficient. This makes it impractical to trade derivatives on-chain with meaningful volume. Order Books, although different also suffer through liquidity issues on-chain. Deep liquid books are not currently available on-chain and are the reason that 99% of derivatives volume is traded on centralised exchanges, as opposed to just ~80% of spot trading. By solving the liquidity conundrum, ChronoX aims to increase adoption of derivatives trading on-chain on Arbitrum.


Objectives:
 We want to establish Arbitrum as the home for a new primitive of highly liquid and high throughput on-chain derivatives trading. At the end of our development roadmap we envision a CEX like experience for users on a secure, decentralised on-chain platform. Coingecko reported ~2,460 billion in derivatives trading volume during 
March 2023
 alone. 
This puts into perspective the potential gain for Arbitrum that would come from taking market share.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):






Time spent at maximum overall interest (OI): This will demonstrate that ChronoX is operating at maximum capacity and serves a direct measure for adoption of the platform.






Increasing number of profitable traders: We want to see an increasing number of profitable traders on ChronoX as these users are most likely to provide sustainable growth to the platform.






Increasing volume and fees: With the above KPIs positively met, increased platform revenue will provide more opportunity for us to incentivise traders and bolster revenue for the Chronos ecosystem.






How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:
 By solving on-chain perpetuals limitations through a new level of capital efficiency: Through the ARMFQ model and integrating with trading engine built by SYMMIO, analyses show that ChronoX will achieve spectacular increases in 
capital efficiency




728x more capital efficient than GMX


90-100x more capital efficient than Gains Network / Level Finance




ChronoX will eliminate the need for significant amounts of idle liquidity. After a trader opens a request, the engine will source liquidity from a network of institutionally backed market makers. This is what allows for orders of magnitude higher efficiency, as the trading engine operates through liquidity aggregation to complete a trade instead of liquidity fragmentation. Through ChronoX significantly less capital will be required to scale the platform. Furthermore, by significantly reducing the cost of liquidity this will allow new builders to leverage plentiful liquidity to build new products on top of ChronoX. For example, a completely trustless and hedged stablecoin (see 
Ethena
) that removes the need for centralised intermediaries becomes possible.


Justification for the size of the grant:
 Arbitrum has an excellent opportunity to deploy ARB and establish the network as the home of intent-based derivatives trading. Given the availability of the trading engine on competing chains, we believe that our strategy is necessary to attract the best traders onto Arbitrum and to capture significant market share. By using ARB to incentivise traders based on PnL this will bring organic growth and is a genuine benchmark for assessment.


To this end, we have requested a total of 100,000 ARB which over the course of 13 weeks is projected to generate $204,955 in revenue.
 Our estimate here is based on the user adoption for the recently launched Thena implementation of the SYMMIO engine. Given that ChronoX will have trading incentives and Thena did not over the period we analysed, we believe that our growth estimate is likely to be conservative.


Please see 
Projections
 here:


Execution Strategy: ChronoX v0.81: (launching on the 1st of November 2023) will launch with over 100 assets and up to 40x leverage. The trading engine audit has been completed and in partnership with SYMMIO we are in the process of enabling the infrastructure stack to be accessible on Arbitrum. In support of our commitment we are already developing a functional UI:


Audit
 / 
UI


Revenue Structure:
 ChronoX exemplifies our commitment to maximise value creation that is shared by the entire community. In line with this, 100% of revenue and ARB will be used to drive liquidity for Arbitrum ecosystem pairs.




100% of fee revenue will buy back CHR that will be max locked into veCHR. We will use this veCHR to bribe core ETH/ARB CL pools to fulfil our goal of being an infrastructure for liquidity growth that benefits the Arbitrum ecosystem. More broadly, this will support Arbitrum LP returns denominated in CHR across all pools.




ChronoX Revenue
1067×600 52 KB


Grant Timeline:
 
ARB is only deliverable after the ChronoX launch.


We will allocate a proportional share of 7,692 ARB to traders each week based on PnL and will deliver this retroactively starting from the day of launch on November 1st and then normally as based on the bi-weekly stream. We will have an open volume and PnL dashboard for the platform that will allow for monitoring of distributions.


PART TWO: Chronos TAG


Objectives:
 Arbitrum currently sits in a strong position as the leading ETH layer 2 as measured by TVL. The economic strength and sustainability of the ecosystem will be increasingly threatened if protocols find it cheaper to build liquidity on new and competing chains. Through Chronos TAG, we want to drive the future strength of Arbitrum through a capacity to support protocols through a highly efficient and sustainable public value creation layer that can bootstrap and sustain liquidity at low cost.




Cementing Arbitrum as the ETH layer 2 for protocols




Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
 The basis for the sustainability and value creation potential for the Chronos TAG economy relies on participants needing to provide value (lock CHR and bribe) to compete for ARB incentives. This creates a competition that self optimises for mutual value creation with participants that are aligned with long-term goals. A growing number of participants aligned in this way will deepen liquidity through increasingly robust LP returns denominated in CHR and will provide a wider range of deeper pools available for Arbitrum traders. To this end, we will track the following KPIs that can measure the effectiveness of Chronos TAG to achieve its’ goals over each epoch (7 days):




Increasing numbers of new Arbitrum native and current partner protocols bribing


Increasing number of total pools bribed


Increasing average and total value of bribes on Chronos


Increasing number of new Arbitrum native and existing partners max locking CHR


Increasing number of total pools on Chronos


Increasing liquidity for Chronos UNIV2 style and CL pools




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:
 To analyse the effectiveness of the Chronos model to create value, we previously performed a study (May-July 2023) to understand which Arbitrum DEXs are most able to generate revenue from volume. 
The data showed that Chronos was the premier revenue generating DEX on Arbitrum
. This makes Chronos a good choice to provide a multiplicative effect on incentives and will serve as a growth catalyst for the Arbitrum ecosystem. Chronos TAG is significantly more sustainable than liquidity mining and maximises value creation for Arbitrum whilst ensuring governance decentralisation.

Chronos has significant potential for revenue maximisation for Arbitrum users from incentives




Tied to Chronos TAG will be a Chronos TAG dashboard. This will allow tracking of protocols / wallets that have derived benefits from the programme and will show how Chronos TAG is performing. Additionally, through an “ARB Impact” data graph. The graph will show how each ARB spent has translated into value generated on Chronos.




A robust, transparent framework that shows demonstrable impact and encourages positive sum behaviour




We have established partnerships with 35+ protocols on Arbitrum including key ecosystem players such as Radiant, Frax, Tangible and PlutusDAO that operate across different DeFi applications. We will continue to seek new partnerships to grow the liquidity hub and will always provide treasury veCHR to give protocols a head-start at building liquidity at low cost. We have already given over 6,000,000 veCHR to bootstrap protocols. Additionally, Chronos TAG will support smaller Arbitrum native projects. This will help foster the next generation of applications on Arbitrum.




Chronos is already a liquidity hub for several key ecosystem players


Chronos has a low-cost method for new protocols to bootstrap liquidity


We will focus on supporting new and innovative Arbitrum native protocols




We launched with no outside or VC investment and instead chose to bootstrap the project through an open-to-all NFT collection and airdropped 55% of our initial supply to protocols and users from other ve(3,3) projects.




We are 100% Arbitrum community owned




In just 5 months, Chronos has amassed over $265M in trading volume, has created $4.7M in emissions value for Arbitrum LPs and has generated $2.25M+ in real swap fee and bribe revenue that is entirely shared with Arbitrum protocols and users.




100% of real revenue that Chronos generates is shared with protocols and users




Justification for the size of the grant:
 As previously noted, data supports the efficacy and cost-effectiveness that bribe and locking incentives can provide for an ecosystem. This represents an opportunity for Arbitrum to derive significant value for money.


To derive reasonable ARB values for Chronos TAG, we have assumed that the programme will provide a 3-4x effect on TVL and revenue. For reference Velodrome saw a ~400% increase in TVL following the initial OP grant: (
https://defillama.com/protocol/velodrome
). Our current TVL is at $4.1M and thus we analysed the current distribution of veCHR value and tracked historical user and partner bribing and locking behaviour and have retroactively applied the Chronos TAG criteria to obtain the most accurate possible request that takes into account our value creation multiple.


Please see our 
projections here
:


We hope that this shows that we are making the best possible assessment for the use of ARB and by providing a robust KPI framework for Chronos TAG that will be included into our bi-weekly report, Arbitrum has a clear path for assessment that is cost-protective for funds.


Execution Strategy:
 Funds will be streamed into our operational multisig:

We will track all wallets that bribe, provide liquidity and lock veCHR under the Chronos TAG criteria. Partners must follow the specified Chronos TAG rules. At the flip of each epoch, rewards will be distributed based.


The effectiveness of the programme will rely on refinement to maximise efficiency. We hope the Arbitrum community will appreciate the data modelling that used real data to derive reasonable values for our proposal and our meritocratic method that provides robust benchmarks for assessment.


Grant Timeline:
 Following delivery of the first bi-weekly stream that will fund Chronos TAG for 14 days (53,125 ARB), we will distribute incentives through our operational multisig retroactively (if necessary) starting a day after the voting period deadline (12th of October). This coincides with a new epoch on Chronos. Chronos TAG will continue until the end of the grant period. Additionally, should our expected values fall short of our projections, our bi-weekly report will be used alongside our KPIs to augment the request to the most appropriate value.


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?:
 Yes


SECTION 5: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:
 Yes


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?:
 27th April 2023


Protocol Performance:


Access to extensive DEX performance metrics can be found through our data analytics dashboard: 
https://dune.com/0xkhmer/chronos
.


Highlights include:






In 5 months, Chronos has generated $265M+ in volume, created $4.7M in emissions value for Arbitrum LPs and has shared all $2.25M of real bribe and swap fee revenue with our partner protocols and 4000+ veCHR and 150+ chrNFT holders.






We have partnered with 35+ projects across a range of applications on Arbitrum.






Launched a live custom built financial NFT marketplace for veCHR and chrNFTs: 
https://marketplace.chronos.exchange/






In collaboration with Dyson, we launched a custom and automated low cost, high volume concentrated liquidity management solution that reached $1M in TVL and has brought an increase of 200-500% in fees/volume. We are imminently launching CLM pools for partners such as Radiant, Frax, Plutus DAO, Liquid Driver and are available to any partner.






A full V2 upgrade: 1) Doubled weekly emissions decay and reduced the total theoretical supply by 35% 2) Increased our maNFT emissions boost curve from 2x at 6 weeks to 3x at 12 weeks 3) Enabled cross maturity adding and merging for maNFTs of any boost level 4) UI/UX upgrade 5) In collaboration with Orbs Network, we enabled TWAP and limit orders for traders.






Protocol Roadmap:
 In line with our design ethos, our future is geared towards creating significant revenue streams that are sustainable and are 100% shared to benefit Arbitrum users.






ChronoX is at the forefront of a highly innovative intent-based derivatives exchange model. Through revenue generated, this has the potential to drive liquidity for Arbitrum ecosystem pairs.






We want to solve the current lack of a low-cost liquidity infrastructure layer on Arbitrum. Through Chronos TAG this will enable new and existing protocols to have the lowest costs for liquidity building and maintenance, whilst simultaneously generating significant increases in real DEX revenue






In Q4 2023, we will be launching a new CL platform on Chronos to provide a wider variety of CLM solutions and manual UNIV3 positions






Audit History:
 Please see our ImmuneFi bug bounty programme that summarises the scope for bounties and our audited code and contract addresses: 
Chronos Bug Bounties | Immunefi
.


In summary, our smart contracts were forked from Thena V1. The Thena smart contract codebase was inherited from Velodrome that had undergone robust auditing (
Code4rena | Keeping high severity bugs out of production
) and were subject to a bug bounty contest (
Code4rena | Keeping high severity bugs out of production
).


The codebase taken from Thena for Chronos V1 was previously subject to a comprehensive audit and was determined to be secure. Downloaded it here: 
https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Thena-v1.0.pdf
. Additionally, the Chronos V1 implementation underwent a Certik audit and was verified to be secure (
Chronos Exchange - CertiK Skynet Project Insight
).


Furthermore, our V2 gauge upgrade and Chronos Marketplace contracts underwent a Peckshield audit, where no outstanding vulnerabilities remain and can be verified here: (

SECTION 6: Data and Reporting


Is your team prepared to create Dune Dashboards for your incentive program?:
 We have a dedicated service provider for dashboards. Our current dashboard allows anyone to access all DEX metrics and already meets the necessary criteria for reporting: 
https://dune.com/0xkhmer/chronos
.


We will create new dashboards specific to the Arbitrum grant to enable the most transparent reporting possible:






Chronos TAG Dashboard:
 This will include a veCHR locking and Chronos bribe leaderboard that will allow us to track new locks that are eligible for TAG incentives. Similarly, the leaderboard will be coupled to partner bribing to track boosts and will all show ARB distributed to all wallets






Tied to this will be an “ARB Impact” data graph. A graph will show how each ARB spent has translated into value generated on Chronos every 4 epochs.






ChronoX Dashboard:
 A leaderboard that tracks the top traders based on PnL and volume and shows how ARB incentives have been distributed.






Should any of the leaderboards not be functional, we have internal tracking that will allow us to quickly generate a report that tracks all ARB distributions.






Does your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread?:
 Yes


Does your team acknowledge that failure to comply with any of the above requests can result in the halting of the program’s funding stream?:
 Yes"

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size:


1,500,000 ARB


Grant Matching:


Yes, Frax will continue to incentivize pools alongside the ARB provided by this grant.


Grant Breakdown:


This grant is to incentivize users of both Frax stablecoins and staked ETH tokens, so that the Frax ecosystem’s extensive mainnet user base is attracted to try out Arbitrum’s growing DeFi ecosystem.


Incentives will be divided between sfrxETH, frxETH, FRAX, and FPI (Frax’s unique flatcoin) with a target of utilizing all of the funds no later than 
January 31, 2024
. In order for incentives to boost usage, but not attract the most mercenary “hot money”, the rewards program under this grant plan will target a total yield of 120% the unsubsidized yield on each pool.


The list of 
currently incentivized pools for Frax products can be found here
. Currently, there are 40 pools across 6 Arbitrum protocols being incentivized. Frax Finance, however, is AMM/paired-token agnostic and actively seeks additional partnerships in the Arbitrum economy. If your preferred protocol or token is not present on this list, then please reach out on the Frax Finance forum to discuss possible collaborations (please wait until after the close of the vote to approve this grant).

Contract Address:


TBD; see “Funding Address Characteristics” section.


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives:


Leverage the Frax brand to entice new users and new assets to Arbitrum, provide a healthier competitive landscape for Arbitrum stablecoin and staked Ether markets, and establish permanent capital flows into Arbitrum from Ethereum.


Frax Finance has one of the most widely recognized brands in DeFi. While it started as – and is most associated with – being a stablecoin, it has grown into a suite of products that provide infrastructure for DeFi protocols. Today, Frax products include stablecoins, bridging, lending, oracles, swapping, and a liquid staked ETH product.


Frax has products necessary for a healthy DeFi ecosystem – FRAX stablecoin for liquidity and transactions, and sfrxETH for yield-bearing collateral securing Arbitrum’s L1 – as well as the co-incentives and commitment to keep the Arbitrum markets for those products competitive.


Frax has users present on more than a dozen chains. Arbitrum, however, has become the hub for Frax activity outside of Ethereum mainnet. This grant will help encourage migration of existing Frax users and their assets from other chains to Arbitrum, increasing both the number of users and the amount of assets actively interacting with Arbitrum.


At the same time, increasing the already-growing presence of both FRAX and ETH staked through Frax will be beneficial to the Arbitrum economy, which is at risk of becoming subject to a de facto stablecoin duopoly and staked ETH monopoly. Frax Finance has a long history of proactively working with integration partners and putting user experience first, and Arbitrum needs a decentralized stablecoin that won’t neglect or ignore the ecosystem. FRAX rounds out a healthy stablecoin ecosystem for users wishing to diversify from only USDC and USDT.


Frax Ether is the third-largest staked ETH token that isn’t controlled by an exchange
. Arbitrum benefits by encouraging staked ETH to be imported, because it is a yield-bearing asset that sources the yield directly from Ethereum while also securing the chain Arbitrum is rooted to. sfrxETH present on Arbitrum creates a constant capital flow from Ethereum to Arbitrum, increasing the total assets on the chain, while also being packaged in a form that allows for ongoing DeFi activity.


852×956 149 KB

Source: 
Frax Facts


At present and historically, sfrxETH yields more than alternatives, making it an ideal asset to incentivize to migrate to Arbitrum. Whenever a sfrxETH is bridged to Arbitrum, that initiates a passive, automatic capital flow (denominated in ETH) into the Arbitrum economy.


Once mainnet frxETH and FRAX users experience the low costs, exciting new DeFi protocols, and ease of using Arbitrum, we are confident those users will not only domicile their frxETH on Arbitrum over mainnet, but also migrate their other assets to Arbitrum.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

The following critical milestones will determine whether this grant has met its goals.

TBD








How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


The grant will have three goals, both of which will increase the size and resilience of Arbitrum’s ecosystem.


The primary goal is to leverage Frax Finance’s extensive community to encourage migration of users and assets to Arbitrum. Frax’s brand and multichain user base make it an ideal way to introduce users to Arbitrum. The incentives from this grant, along with Frax Finance co-incentives, serve to entice users to take that first step onto Arbitrum.


The second goal is to create a more healthy, sustainable competitive landscape for both stablecoins and liquid staked ETH. The 
“Rule of Three”
 is widely accepted in business and economics schools as the number of major suppliers needed for an efficient market. FRAX, which actively engages with the Arbitrum ecosystem and puts its own incentives in place, makes an ideal decentralized stablecoin to complete that trio with USDC and USDT. Frax Ether is the obvious choice to complete a similar trio in the market with stETH and rETH, as the third largest liquid staking provider not controlled by an exchange with a competing chain.


The final goal is to use Frax Ether to increase the overall usage of staked ETH, which passively and reliably imports capital to Arbitrum, which is hungry for more capital, from Ethereum, where capital is relatively abundant. This is in many ways similar to how recent “tokenized tbill” offerings on mainnet import capital from the USA to Ethereum. As capital flows from Ethereum to Arbitrum, that capital can then be put to work, often by improving access to and depth of local credit markets.


Justification for the size of the grant:

The size of the request is to ensure subsidized pools have a yield that is modestly above the natural yield. Incentives will target a total yield of 120% of the unsubsidized yield on each pool through January 31, 2024.


This is to create a policy of modest incentivization spread across the ecosystem. The goal is not to provide such a large shock to rates that it results in only the most mercenary capital chasing yield, as opposed to “fence sitters” who can be convinced to try the Arbitrum ecosystem and Frax products with only marginal increases in yield.


Excess grant funds will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO Treasury address (0xf3fc178157fb3c87548baa86f9d24ba38e649b58) as the sunset of the grant plan.


Execution Strategy:


Frax incentive structure is designed to directly correlate with the TVL and trading volume of pools and vaults within the ecosystem. This means that as TVL and trading activity increase, so do the rewards for liquidity providers, creating a mutually beneficial relationship that stimulates liquidity growth and ecosystem expansion. Moreover, during the initial month following the creation of a new pool or vault, Frax Finance will match the incentives provided by partners for the pool or vault.

Frax contributors have developed an automated incentive distribution contract. The contract is programmed with the reward calculation for targeted pools, and allows for distribution of incentives to avoid error-prone manual processes. An example is this contract for FRAX on Arbitrum : 0x9cF1b09a30dbDED5Aa0B270901A9B8ab0b4C9f29


Grant Timeline:


Funds will be distributed as incentives in a linear fashion to the selected pools. The use of an automated incentive contract is intended to remove the need for further team efforts.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives:
 The primary objective of this grant proposal is to further enhance the Arbitrum ecosystem’s liquidity efficiency through DefiEdge’s integration with key DEXs like Camelot, Uniswap, Sushiswap, Arbitrum Exchange and Ramses. Specifically, we aim to:


Boost Liquidity Efficiency:
 Significantly improve the capital efficiency of liquidity providers on Arbitrum, making their assets work harder for them and reducing capital waste.


Increase User Adoption:
 Attract more users to the Arbitrum network by offering a more capital-efficient and attractive trading experience, driving growth in trading volume and user numbers.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):


To measure the success of this grant proposal, we will track the following KPIs:


Capital Efficiency Enhancement: By strategically integrating with prominent DEXs such as Camelot, Uniswap, Sushiswap, Arbitrum Exchange, and Ramses on the Arbitrum network, DefiEdge is poised to orchestrate a remarkable reduction in capital inefficiency. This integration not only bolsters liquidity but also elevates capital efficiency, contributing to our goal of optimizing over 70% of Arbitrum’s liquidity.


What sets our approach apart is the meticulous execution of strategies. While enhancing capital efficiency, our strategies simultaneously generate consistent fee earnings and minimize impermanent loss, ensuring that liquidity providers enjoy the best of both worlds. This multifaceted strategy empowers the Arbitrum network to thrive, attracting more participants, fostering innovation, and building a sustainable DeFi ecosystem.


Efficient management of v3 pools can get more volume and fees for the LPs and DEXs and that can be seen from the analysis that even with less than 50% of what is on camelot v2, v3 is having 2.5x more volume and also is quite similar in terms of the fees generated


Liquidity Growth: Increase the total liquidity on the Arbitrum network as a result of this integration, thereby expanding the network’s attractiveness to traders and liquidity providers. With our automised strategies that can actually make the rebalancing and user liquidity sticky


User Onboarding: Attract at least 100% more users to Arbitrum DEXs within the project’s timeline by offering a more efficient and appealing trading environment. Also with, these efficient strategies make POL more efficient and promote more protocols to launch pools on Arbitrum


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


Receiving this grant will enable DefiEdge to play a pivotal role in fostering substantial growth and innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem, primarily through:


Promoting Permissionless Liquidity Management: Our grant empowers users and strategy managers to leverage our permissionless platform. Several strategy managers have harnessed this feature to create unique strategies, optimizing liquidity within concentrated liquidity DEXs. This permissionless approach sparks creativity and diversity in strategy deployment, which is fundamental for the growth of decentralized finance on Arbitrum.


1600×790 137 KB


Capital Efficiency Unleashed: DefiEdge’s integration with Camelot, Uniswap, Ramses, and more, amplifies the liquidity efficiency within these platforms. By allowing users to deploy assets more efficiently, we drive a surge in the capital locked in these DEXs, encouraging sustainable growth and resilience in the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem.


Expanding Ecosystem Adoption: Our commitment to capital-efficient trading experiences will undoubtedly draw a wider audience to Arbitrum DEXs. As more users embrace these enhanced liquidity options, innovation and activity on the network will naturally follow suit. This, in turn, spurs further development and advancements within the Arbitrum ecosystem.


Driving Continuous Innovation: With our profound expertise in liquidity management and DeFi, DefiEdge is well-positioned to drive innovation within the Arbitrum landscape. We continually explore novel strategies and technologies to optimize liquidity further, setting the stage for a vibrant and ever-evolving ecosystem.


Justification for the size of the grant:


Integrating with leading DEXs on Arbitrum, we aim to enhance capital efficiency by leveraging over 70% of the liquidity present. Our automated strategies simplify the process of bringing on Projects (POL). A blockchain’s vitality is often gauged by its Total Value Locked (TVL) and liquidity. Our mission is to ensure that Arbitrum’s pools maintain robust liquidity, promote increased swaps, and foster a thriving, long-term ecosystem. With over 1,900 LPs and numerous permissionless strategy managers, we’re positioning Arbitrum as the go-to chain for market makers and users who prioritize efficient liquidity management.


Execution Strategy:
 We will begin by integrating with the identified DEXs on Arbitrum within the first month, followed by the creation and deployment of liquidity management strategies in the second month.


Grant Timeline:


Month 1: Start incentivisation of bluechip pairs on arbitrum chain across integrated DEXs

Month 2: Start incentivisation of ecosystem tokens and create better liquid pools for them

Month 3: Analyse the performance of the strategies and create the roadmap for incentives ahead

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.






Requested Grant Size: 500,000 ARB






Grant Matching: QiDao will provide $WETH and $QI incentives






Funding Address: arb: 0x6c56271C688F16F50974Ea0B79D80936af374ae1


Funding Address Characteristics: 2/4 multisig used by QiDao for incentives programs.


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives:


Leverage QiDao’s products to create more natively minted stablecoins on Arbitrum, building a robust liquidity base with other decentralized stablecoins that is not reliant on centralized actors.


QiDao is the most used CDP stablecoins in crypto, with more active borrowers than other major CDP platforms. MAI is a key part of many DeFi ecosystems, allowing L2 users access to tools previously kept in L1.


This grant will allow QiDao to continue to partner with other protocols on Arbitrum. The protocol is already working with several projects deployed on Arbitrum. Any incentives used by QiDao will be in partnership with other projects, increasing the impact of ARB incentives. Protocols that QiDao is already working with on Arbitrum include Frax, Kyber, Ramses, Chronos, Stargate, Axelar, Gains, and Beefy.


ARB tokens can be used to mint MAI directly on Arbitrum, which provides an important flywheel for the Arbitrum ecosystem. As more ARB tokens are emitted via incentives campaigns, QiDao will seek to attract ARB deposits and prevent dumping.

How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?


This grant proposal has two main goals, which aim to increase interoperability between projects on Arbitrum.


The primary goal is to use QiDao’s native-first model to create more stables minted natively on Arbitrum with assets that belong to Arbitrum and the greater Ethereum ecosystem: ARB token, project-specific tokens like gDAI and stETH-ETH Curve LPs, as well as Ethereum LSTs (stETH, rETH, and sfrxETH). This grant, QiDao’s co-incentives, and our partnerships with teams like Lido, Frax, Curve, and others, will attract users to mint stablecoins natively on Arbitrum.


The second goal is to foster interoperability between projects. What makes DeFi better than TradFi is the ability to connect various projects seamlessly. QiDao has already executed major integrations with most of DeFi’s long-standing projects. With Lido, for example, QiDao ran a minting incentives campaign, which accounted for over 50% of Curve’s stETH-ETH liquidity on Optimism at the time. On Arbitrum, QiDao has plans to integrate several projects to increase interoperability. These projects include:




Frax: sfrxETH as collateral & joint liquidity for decentralized stables


Lido: stETH derivative collaterals


Inverse: decentralized stable co-LM


Kyber: smart liquidity via Elastic


Curve: LPs as collateral


Aave: amTokens as collateral. MAI already listed on Aave


Gains: gDAI as collateral


GMX: GLP as collateral


Ramses: Liquidity growth




In addition to these collaborations, QiDao will release sMAI. This token will represent deposits in QiDao’s stability pool. sMAI will be fungible and transferable, allowing for integrations with other projects such as AMMs, lending markets, and other stablecoins. MAI already has a Chainlink oracle, which will facilitate integrations.


Bridging into Arbitrum will be limited to encourage native minting against native assets, and prevent short term farming.


Justification for the size of the grant:


The grant size is optimal for running a conservative and targeted incentives campaign. QiDao currently attracts the largest number of stablecoin minters in DeFi with minimal and focused incentives.


What sets QiDao apart is partnerships. By collaborating with other projects like Balancer, Frax, and other major DeFi projects, QiDao can ensure that there are no APR shocks. Avoiding excessive hikes in incentives, Arbitrum will be able to get the most ROI from these grants.


Excess grant funds will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO Treasury address (0xf3fc178157fb3c87548baa86f9d24ba38e649b58) as the sunset of the grant plan.


Execution Strategy: [Describe the plan for executing including resources, products, use of funds, and risk management. This includes allocations for specific pools, eligible assets, products, etc.]


QiDao has a number of automated processes that will aid it in distributing incentives.




Borrow incentives: incentives for minting MAI against ARB and other synergistic assets will have set APRs, allowing the DAO to control the efficiency of incentives. This will also have great effects on demand for ARB as well as other value-add assets like sfrxETH


NFT achievements: to focus on interoperability, QiDao has developed a fully onchain achievements platform to track user actions. This will allow incentives to be distributed with much greater precision. This platform is open-source and available to any teams looking to improve their incentives efforts


Other incentives distributions will be automatically deployed via partnerships with other stablecoins as well as DEXs




Grant Timeline:


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream? Yes


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Provide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?: Yes, QiDao is native to Arbitrum. MAI is minted directly on Arbitrum against assets that exist on Arbitrum.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?: QiDao is deployed on multiple chains, which will aid in bringing more gas fee-minded users to Arbitrum. These chains are: Polygon, Ethereum, Fantom, Moonbeam, zkEVM, BNB, Optimism, Avalanche, Base, Metis, and Gnosis.


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?: QiDao launched native MAI on Arbitrum on April 2022


Protocol Performance:




Usage: QiDao is the most used CDP stablecoin project, with over 10k active minters. In comparison with other major stablecoins like MakerDAO and Liquity, which have 2,300 and 1,100 active lending respectively.


Integrations of MAI: QiDao has integrated its stablecoin into most major DeFi platforms. A few of these platforms are Aave, Curve, Balancer, Layer Zero, Axelar, and Kyber.


Integrations within QiDao: the protocol has built added lego blocks from most major DeFi plafforms. A few of these integrations include Curve LPs, Aave aTokens, Axelar axlTokens, and Gains’s gDAI.


Long-term builders: MAI is one of the few stablecoins deployed natively outside of Ethereum that has existed for several years. While many stablecoins from Ethereum have continued to exist with few issues, most of the stablecoins launched outside of Ethereum no longer exist. This has been due to teams leaving as well as hacks.




Protocol Roadmap:




Cross Chain Protocol (CCP): QiDao’s open-source module on Safe for protocols to automate operations and voting across several chains. As one of the first crosschain DAOs, QiDao has continued to innovate in this space. CCP is slated to be released at SmartCon in October.


sMAI: QiDao’s stability pool will allow MAI holders to benefit from liquidation activity. Being fungible, sMAI will provide native yield for projects integrating MAI.


QiDao V3: the next iteration of QiDao is coming to Arbitrum. This version takes years of experience at QiDao and will make Arbitrum a hub for stablecoin innovation. More details will be released in the coming weeks.


Native Native Native: MAI is minted directly on Arbitrum, which increases its benefits to the ecosystem. This is in contrast with stablecoins that are merely bridged to Arbitrum.


Aave Guardians: QiDao has adopted the Aave Guardians standard to secure its smart contracts: 
Snapshot




Audit History:




QiDao has been live for almost 3 years, and has been audited 3 times. It has also been reviewed by several peer teams.




SECTION 5: Data and Reporting


Is your team prepared to create Dune Dashboards for your incentive program?: Yes, or an alternative dashboard with the same information.


Does your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread? Yes


Does your team acknowledge that failure to comply with any of the above requests can result in the halting of the program’s funding stream?: Yes"

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size:


200,000 ARB


P.S: Reduced our grant request from 400,000 ARB to 200,000 ARB based on feedback


Grant Matching:


$400,000 in TIME tokens.


Minimum 1% of the total TIME token supply to be distributed on Arbitrum network during phase 1 of pre-mine, from Oct ‘23 to Jan ‘24.


TIME tokens will begin distribution with a pre-mine period from mid-October 2023, with a reference valuation of our seed round at $40mn FDV.


The proposed 1% supply of TIME tokens is valued at $400,000 as per our seed round valuation.


Grant Breakdown:


40% of the grant allocated as incentives to ARB markets.


30% of the grant allocated as incentives to ETH (WETH or wstETH) markets.


30% of the grant allocated as incentives to other markets such as Pendle, Trader Joe, GMX, Plutus, etc. (will not be utilized to incentivize TIME token pools, if any)

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives:




To introduce & encourage users on Arbitrum to a new DeFi primitive that enables secure Oracle-less lending


To enable deeper liquidity and higher capital efficiency for ARB & ETH markets on Timeswap, thereby introducing Oracle-less lending to new set of users


To enable deeper liquidity for high quality collateral that cannot be listed on other money markets - Assets from following protocols - Pendle, GMX, Trader Joe etc


Enable credit to otherwise underserved markets (e.g., long-tail assets, staked assets, LP tokens, etc.) in a secure and scalable manner




Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):




TVL for incentivised pools


Lend and Borrow volume for incentivised pools


User acquisition rate for incentivised pools


Comparables of the above versus non-incentivised pools




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?


Timeswap is a new DeFi primitive for credit markets (i.e., money markets). We create money markets that operate without the need for oracles or on-chain liquidity, due to our non-liquidatable and fixed-term design enabled by our unique 3-variable AMM


This provides us with the unique ability of creating secure and scalable money markets for any assets(ERC-20 or ERC-4626). By any, we mean any — we are not restricted by oracle support for the asset, which is a major blocker for asset listing in oracle-dependent money markets.


Money markets in itself unlocks capital, boosting capital efficiency and bringing additional utility to tokens. By incentivising deep liquidity in Timeswap pools, not only are users secure from oracle manipulation attacks but it also enables large transactions, leading to greater overall capital efficiency. The strongest benefit of a capital efficient protocol/ecosystem is its ability to scale quickly.


By incentivising the main pools (ARB and ETH markets), a trickle down effect to other markets already live on Timeswap (e.g., Pendle’s PT-GLP, StaFi’s rETH, TraderJoe’s sJOE, WooFi’s weWETH, etc.) will begin. Thus indirectly boosting capital efficiency across our partner protocols and the greater Arbitrum ecosystem.


Justification for the size of the grant:


Timeswap has been live on Arbitrum since March 23, 2023 and have supported the creation of money markets for over 20 assets, mostly which could not be listed elsewhere due to oracle dependencies and liquidity requirements. More information on the listed assets can be found in the ‘Protocol Performance’ segment , under Section 4.


Timeswap will match the approved grant size with $TIME tokens, all to be used as incentives for the approved pools.


The grant will allow Timeswap to scale by creating money markets for new assets and deepening our existing markets.


Execution Strategy:


100% of the allocations will be used for liquidity mining incentives to be distributed to end users during the proposed period from Oct ‘23 to Jan ‘24


A summary of the distribution:




40% of the grant allocated as incentives to ARB markets.


30% of the grant allocated as incentives to ETH markets.


30% of the grant allocated as incentives to other markets.

The non-ARB/ETH markets to be incentivised will be shared in the bi-weekly reports and subject to comments/feedback from the community.


For efficacy purposes, incentives to the non-ARB/ETH markets will only be allocated to markets where the underlying assets is a governance/LP/receipt token of an established project, as per the discretion of the community. (Will not be allocated to TIME token pool)


The incentives will be fully distributed no later than January 31, 2024.


Any ARB incentives not distributed will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size:


200,000 ARB
 (adjusted from original 500,000 ARB ask, with more details 
here
)


Qualification Check:




Beacon Grants
 (<= 200K ARB)

Live on Arbitrum for at least 2 months

Meets one of the following criteria:

$1.5M TVL

$2M 30D cumulative volume




PancakeSwap would be live on Arbitrum for >2 months by end of voting period - 
 Beacon

PancakeSwap has $2.9M in TVL - 
 Beacon

PancakeSwap has $61M in 30d cumulative volume - 
 Beacon


Grant Matching:


156,000 CAKE (
100%
 of grant value based on current prices)


Over the next year, PancakeSwap is committed to match the grant with at least 156,000 CAKE (~100% of grant’s value based on current prices). This is distributed via our 
yield farms
, and has been ongoing since we deployed on Arbitrum.


EDIT: There was an oversubscription rate of 2.5x after the application deadline closed, hence we proportionally reduced our grant request amount to 200k ARB. This small, but meaningful decision was also made after noticing many homegrown projects applying for the grant.


Grant Breakdown:




80k ARB (40%) will be used to incentivize liquidity for core pairs, such as USDC-ETH, USDT-ETH, USDC-USDT, and ARB-ETH – this is essential for other DeFi legos (especially lending / borrowing protocols) to operate smoothly


120k ARB (60%) will be used to incentivize liquidity for non-core pairs, and to increase traction for high-impact products that we intend to port over to Arbitrum. Where appropriate, we will incentivize liquidity for ARB-TOKEN pairs.




EDIT: We changed to a 40-60 allocation split after listening to community feedback. This way, a larger proportion of the grant tokens will go towards incentivizing native projects’ liquidity, as well as attracting newer projects to deploy on Arbitrum


As our PancakeSwap users are significantly sticky to our DEX, we will use the 40% allocation to build up an adequate amount of liquidity for core tokens (e.g. ARB/ETH/USDC/USDT).


For non-core pairs, we will prioritize pairs that will attract high volumes and TVL; we will employ a manual process to identify and incentivize key pairs on Arbitrum, reviewing and adjusting our distribution allocation weekly. We commit to communicating these distributions and rationale to the Arbitrum community every two weeks. Where appropriate, we will do ARB-TOKEN pairs.


For high-impact products, we will look to port over both (i) battle-tested products which have demonstrated a track record of traction and usage (e.g. our 
Prediction product
), and (ii) newer (and more experimental) products which may have the potential to meaningfully benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem and community (e.g. Position Manager Marketplace). Once these products are ported over and start receiving grant tokens, we will communicate their performance to the Arbitrum community every two weeks.


If at the end of the grant period, there are any tokens remaining, they will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO.


Funding Address:

0xeCc90d54B10ADd1ab746ABE7E83abe178B72aa9E

Funding Address Characteristics:

3/6 multisig

Contract Address:


For incentivizing core and non-core pairs, we will be distributing the funds via 
Merkl
 - its relevant smart contracts can be found 
here
.


For incentivizing high-impact products, the method of fund distribution will vary - we will publish the relevant smart contracts in our bi-weekly status updates.


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives:




Increase TVL for Arbitrum through increased liquidity on Arbitrum PancakeSwap


Increase volume, transactions, and sequencer fees for Arbitrum through increased volume on Arbitrum PancakeSwap


Increase user engagement for Arbitrum by cross-pollinating our large user base on the BNB Chain with Arbitrum PancakeSwap




Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):




TVL - to maintain a 30D average of $20M TVL on 1 Mar 2024 (
~8x growth
)


Volume - to target Top 5 DEX by daily volumes (30D average) on 1 Mar 2024 (
~4x growth based on today’s rankings
)


Daily active users (DAU) - to maintain DAU (30D average) of 4,000 on 1 Mar 2024 (
~5x growth
)


Volume / TVL Ratio will be benchmarked with other DEXes, to ensure that grant incentives are distributed efficiently




UPDATE: Despite reducing our grant request, we are keeping the KPIs unchanged. We will continue working towards these targets by the stipulated deadline, although we recognize it will be a more challenging task given our lowered grant request amount.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


It enables us to jumpstart liquidity on Arbitrum, using our battle-tested DEX platform that is already the second largest DEX in total chain volumes. We have started incentivizing liquidity on Arbitrum with CAKE tokens, but this grant would allow us to increase the size and velocity of our incentivization program.


With the grant, we will call on our existing partners on other chains to deploy their protocol and token on Arbitrum, helping them incentivize their token liquidity for a smoother onboarding process. We will also incentivize token pairs of both existing partners and homegrown projects on Arbitrum to help them boost token liquidity and volumes. Where appropriate, we will incentivize ARB-TOKEN pairs.


While we acknowledge that capital is very liquid in this market environment, we are confident that users will continue to use PancakeSwap beyond the incentive period for several empirical reasons: our capital efficient v3 DEX; sizable community reach; wide range of products, and our ability for further incentivization via CAKE in the long-term. We have seen strong evidence for this outcome of sustained protocol (and chain) usage on our various chain deployments.


Once we have garnered a decent user base on Arbitrum, we will look towards bringing over some of our products from the BNB Chain (
Lottery
, 
Pottery
, 
Prediction
, etc.), depending on the community’s needs. Our Perpetuals product is already live on Arbitrum 
here
, while our launchpad product (IFO) is ready for launch - we are in the process of lining up suitable launch projects.


Justification for the size of the grant:


Based on 
@tnorm
’s recommendation, we qualify under the ‘Beacon Grant’ category as our 
30D trading volume
 exceeds $2M, our TVL exceeds $1.5M, and we would have deployed on Arbitrum for >2 months by the end of the voting period.










1181×411 26.8 KB










As of posting, the Week of 24th September has not been concluded, and therefore the volume data for the last bar is incomplete








To meaningfully demonstrate our commitment to Arbitrum’s growth, 
we are intending to match at least 100% of the grant’s dollar value with CAKE over the next year
, ensuring that the growth we anticipate during the grant period will be sustained in the long run.


Further, we have hosted two Galxe campaigns 
here
 and 
here
 to encourage our user base to use Arbitrum PancakeSwap, successfully attracting >8.6k and >2.7k participants to swap and provide LP.


Execution Strategy:




The funds will first be sent to our multisig address 0xeCc90d54B10ADd1ab746ABE7E83abe178B72aa9E


Over a period of 16 weeks, we will manually inject ARB incentives on a weekly basis into the respective smart contracts on Merkl, based on the allocation: 40% to core pairs (e.g. USDC-ETH, USDT-ETH, USDC-USDT, ARB-ETH), and up to 60% to non-core pairs that bring high volumes and TVL. ARB incentives for high-impact products will be handled separately.


Within the core pairs allocation, we will aim to distribute the grant incentive effectively. Our priority is to achieve high volumes and TVL for both PancakeSwap and Arbitrum, and will review and adjust the allocation weekly based on the token pairs’ performance, reporting bi-weekly to the Arbitrum community.


Within the non-core pairs/high-impact products allocation, for non-core pairs, we will similarly aim to distribute the grant incentive effectively. As part of the process, we will manually engage with projects (those within and beyond Arbitrum) and their communities to provide liquidity on Arbitrum PancakeSwap. We aim to attract many of our existing partners on other chains to deploy on Arbitrum PancakeSwap. We will also aim to support homegrown projects. As appropriate, we will incentivize ARB-TOKEN pairs


Within the non-core pairs/high-impact products allocation, for high-impact products, we will distribute the grant incentive to further increase product traction. We are aware that badly-designed products may hide behind extravagant incentives, and will transparently communicate metrics, such as DAU and product activity output, on a bi-weekly basis to the Arbitrum community. For instance, for a product such as Prediction, we may use the grant incentive to augment the payout, to build up a critical mass of users that will be able to sustain more Prediction pairs (e.g. ARB, BTC, ETH, LINK), eventually leading to a growing user base.


Ultimately, for both core and non-core pairs, we will strive to optimize our incentive structure to achieve the highest TVL and volume possible with our given grant size, similar to what we have been doing with our native CAKE emission thus far. The allocation will be reviewed and adjusted weekly based on performance. For benchmarking, as of writing, our Volume/TVL ratio on Arbitrum is roughly 100%, which is fairly efficient.


ARB incentives will be injected with the following parameters on Merkl: 80% fees, 10% Token0, 10% Token1. This is to ensure we encourage liquidity providers to seed tight liquidity in the respective pools, hence optimizing capital efficiency.


We will continue to invite liquidity managers and yield farming protocols to build on top of us to deepen our TVL and improve our user experience. Currently, we are integrated with DeFiEdge on Arbitrum and will be integrated with Gamma shortly. If a liquidity manager has received a grant and is keen on incentivizing the same pair, it will enhance the incentive efficiency of that pair.




Grant Timeline:




200k ARB = 12,500 ARB weekly for 16 weeks


40% to core pairs = 5,000 ARB weekly for 16 weeks


60% to non-core pairs and high-impact products = 7,500 ARB weekly for 16 weeks


~100% CAKE matching will be distributed via our 
yield farms
 over the next year




Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?

Yes

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size
 : 750,000 ARB tokens


Grant Matching
 : $LOGX token Airdrop rewards






Poised for a triple-win = Best ROI of grant. Traders on LogX will get:




LOGX ARB incentives (through this grant)


ARB incentives of other perp DEXes like GMX, MUX, etc.


$LOGX airdrop incentives








Grant Breakdown
 : Will be broken down into 2 parts:




80% for traders incentives






This is for incentivizing traders on the LogX trading platform. This will be focused on growing the 
#traders
, 
#transactions
 per trader, and long-term retention.


We have already found a strong PMF in this offering, and want to double-down on what;s working well for us






20% for SDK integration inside wallets






Integration of LogX SDK inside wallets to provide perp trading to millions of users. Similar to how 1inch or 0x SDKs are integrated inside wallets for swaps.


This is an innovative bet we want to pursue. No one has ever tried this for perps, we want to be the first ones and unlock a new paradigm of growth for perps.


LogX will work with wallets to pass on these incentives to the end users




Funding Address
 : 0xA57146ff13671f730D0D122ed192550A3B235fD7


Funding Address Characteristics:
 This will be 2/3 multisig with private keys securely stored independently.


Contract Address
: Specific contracts will be deployed at a later stage and the addresses will be publicly available. Initially, the funds will be securely kept in a 2/3 multi-sig wallet.


If any portion of the grant remains undistributed, the LogX team commits to returning the remaining funds to the DAO.


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives
 :




Moving CEX traders and volumes to Arbitrum


Increase the TAM of perp trading through wallet integrations, leading to market expansion of DeFi and long-term value creation for the whole ecosystem.


Increase user engagement, repeat transactions, and hence, retention by carefully designing long-term usage incentives


Onboard users from other chains into the Arbitrum ecosystem


Increase the number of transactions per trader


Increase the average transaction value number of transactions per trader


Increase revenue collection for Arbitrum via sequencer fees


Provide better bonding incentives for retail users and Arbitrum-aligned wallets




Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
 :




Monthly Active Traders


Cumulative Trading Volume


Number of new traders per week


Monthly trader retention


Average trade size


Average number of traders per trader per week


Sequencer fees


LogX fees


Open Interest


Quality of wallets trading on LogX


Number of wallet integrations


Number of first-time perp traders acquired through wallets




We understand that one of the primary objectives of the DAO is to measure the impact of this STIP and make further decisions for the long term. To facilitate that, we propose creating a dashboard where we will draw a comparison of performances between pre-incentive, during-incentive, and post-incentive phases for all the above KPIs.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?


Let us first answer the ‘Why now’ before answering the ‘How’:






Why now:




Growing fast, have scaled to almost $100M in organic trading volume within a few weeks


At an inflection point. Best time to fuel growth


Strong PMF, good retention


Interest from wallets for SDK integration


$LOGX Airdrop incentives are also LIVE, which will be a boost








How it will foster growth:




Strategically, the first step in achieving our mission is to acquire traders and maximize the volumes flowing through us. The 80% grant that we wish to allocate directly to traders will be a huge boost in accelerating this. ARB emissions, coupled with LogX’s own airdrop program, will move traders from other ecosystems and CEXes to Arbitrum


Since LogX provides the best execution for perps there can be, we are naturally a go-to partner for wallets wanting to offer perp trading to their users. Most of these are passive customers who do not differentiate much between various chains. So we have a golden opportunity to onboard all of these directly to Arbitrum in a seamless manner. This would foster new growth, more transactions, more fees, more engagement and more TVL.


We are betting on Arbitrum rollups, app-chains, and community mindshare to solidify the network as the go-to place for off-chain options and provide valuable blockspace for the network.








Justification for the size of the grant
 :


We have been Arbitrum native since Day 0 of the LogX journey, and are committed to pulling all levers needed to grow the ecosystem. We are uniquely poised to grow not just the user count & transactions count, but also the TVL.


With regards to the traders’ incentives - we are already up and running with a steady growth of daily traders count. The 50% allocation we have for the trader’s incentives, which amount to 375k ARB, will support the acquisition of up to 10k new traders and a long-term retention of up to 20k traders (including the prior ones we have + the more traders that we are continuing to acquire currently). By the end of Jan 2024, having 20k monthly traders will put LogX ahead of other perp trading platforms across ecosystems like Optimism, and even ahead of certain CEXes. We are committed to bringing more and more users on-chain, and that chain better be Arbitrum.


With regards to the wallet incentives for the LogX SDK integrations - - Wallet incentives will start for a 2-month period (December & January), with the 375k ARB tokens allocated for incentives, we are expecting to get up to 50k traders to test out perp trading inside the wallets powered by LogX. Once they experience it, we are confident of being able to grow it organically from there without the ARB rewards.


Execution Strategy
 :


Our execution strategy is focused on achieving long-term usage of the project, even after the short-term incentives are over.


For both - direct trader incentives as well as wallet integration, we are creating a unique 2-dimensional, exponential curve-based model where the more you trade, and the more volume you do, the more your rewards would receive.


The total rewards pool for trading incentives will be defined for the 100-day period (roughly from Oct 20 to Jan 31). These rewards will be broken into epochs of a 7-day period, and rewards will be transferred at the end of every epoch. The calculation of incentive distribution would take off-chain due to the complexity of the calculation and will be transparently conveyed to the community. These ARB incentives will be coupled with the ongoing $LOGX airdrop rewards campaign.


Grant Timeline
 :




Trader incentives will run from Oct 20th to Jan 31st


Wallet incentives will run from Dec to Jan 31st




LogX Team will create a dashboard in which all of the metrics and KPIs will be tracked at regular intervals to ensure transparency and verifiability.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.

Objectives:


KeplerHomes aims to be the Arbitrum ecosystem’s premier highly playable open world MMORPG.

As we all know, the attention of truly active Web3 users is difficult to focus and lock for a long time. Social@KeplerHomes will solve this problem well and lock users’ attention on the Arbitrum ecosystem. Incentivizing non-Arbitrum chain users to come to Arbitrum is a good start, and Social@KeplerHomes enables interaction between users, allowing their sense of accomplishment to be reflected in the form of price in Social@KeplerHomes, which fundamentally changes the project and relationship between users.


Note: Social is a social gameplay launched by KeplerHomes on Arbitrum One & Twitter before the official launch of the MMOPRG main game, allowing users to trade with each other in the form of Keys.

(Social@Kepler has completed the development of UI, front-end APP, contract and API, and has entered the testing stage before going online. It is expected to be officially launched for Arbitrum network users around October 7, 2023)


Frankly speaking, this was not our original idea, and we are very grateful to Friend.tech for inspiring us. KeplerHomes has made micro-iterations of this type of social gameplay, and will later integrate lightweight social games (such as crypto farms) to enhance the on-chain activity and interactivity of real users. In this way, even if the subsequent incentive amount is small and has no intensity, users can still have fun. The ultimate goal is to increase Arbitrum One’s incremental real user retention and activity, as well as Arbitrum One’s active user traffic, thereby increasing the value of the entire Arbitrum ecosystem.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):


In order to objectively evaluate Social@KeplerHomes’ initiatives in Arbitrum’s short-term incentives, several objectives were set:


1. Add the number of valid user wallet addresses:

Social@KeplerHomes uses the MPC wallet mechanism and a third-party API interface, which is secure and has been verified by large-scale applications. After 0.01 ETH is required to activate the wallet address, it is bound to Twitter to determine the authenticity of the user’s identity and is considered a valid user.


2. User trading activity on Arbitrum:

The Social@KeplerHomes function will deploy a formal contract on Arbitrum One, and the frequency of transactions between users and the contract can be intuitively reflected using Dune.


3. User trading volume on Arbitrum:

Keys Price in Social@KeplerHomes is an important indicator for evaluating users. The recent data results achieved by similar social & gaming applications are obvious to all. Keys Price is also the main driving force for users to promote Arbitrum One &Social@KeplerHomes to their friends in the process of exploring the value of themselves and other players.


4. The total value locked (TVL) of Social@KeplerHomes in the smart contract on Arbitrum:


GameFi does not have a TVL evaluation indicator similar to DEFI, but Friend.tech has achieved amazing explosiveness and stability in TVL in a short period of time. Of course, there are many factors for success. We also objectively realize that this does not mean that Social@KeplerHomes can achieve the same achievements, but it can serve as a good reference basis. Optimistic predictions, cautious predictions, and no exaggeration are the pragmatic work style of the KeplerHomes team. KeplerHomes strives to maximize its combined operating capabilities. Improve the TVL in Arbitrum One and bring more incremental TVL.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


KeplerHomes started building in October 2021, and has now completed updates to 5 internal beta versions of the game (the video of the game has been uploaded to YouTube). From day one when building KeplerHomes, we have been committed to long-termism and the philosophy of building a sustainable, highly playable game. KeplerHomes In the long-term construction and communication process of Arbitrum, we marvel at Arbitrum’s community-oriented, strong execution, and pragmatic governance philosophy. Arbitrum has always insisted on doing the right things. This further strengthens KeplerHomes’ confidence in bringing growth and continuous innovation to the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Specific measures are as follows:






The MMOPRG game is a relatively heavy product development cycle. A long wait does not allow users to see what they get like DEFI applications. How to deliver playable and interactive products to users is something we actively think about and implement. There are many factors that need to be considered: incremental users, bottleneck boundaries, retention rates, real interaction data, TVL contribution, and sustainability. . Social@KeplerHomes is an experience product that we will officially deliver to users on 2023/10/7. The above multiple factors have been considered in the innovation and design of the mechanism. Continuously increasing the correlation between online lightweight gameplay and games is our pragmatic work point.






KeplerHomes has originally developed the NFT MarketPlace, Passport Mint module, Allowlist module, and PreSale module in the Arbitrum ecosystem, and all contracts have been submitted to Github for open source. It can help more developers who want to join the Arbitrum ecosystem, provide them with reference ideas and reduce development costs. Contribute a small amount to the growth of users in the Arbitrum ecosystem. We will continue to optimize and update the user experience of these functional modules in the future.






KeplerHomes is aware that Stylus has technically broken through the bottleneck of EVM and supports C++, C, and Rust, which will greatly improve the performance boundaries of on-chain games. The technology stack applied to KeplerHomes is very complex, covering C++, C#, React, Golang, and Solidity. The KeplerHomes team is fully capable of continuously contributing new functional code modules to the Arbitrum ecosystem, while constantly innovating in game logic and gameplay.






Social@KeplerHomes is an important functional module launched by short-term KeplerHomes in the Aritrum ecosystem. Social can actively bring user growth and the ability to get out of the circle for Arbitrum in many aspects. Social is a very broad concept. From a growth perspective, it is not only Twitter users, but also touches Telegram, Discord, Reddit, Youtube, and FaceBook users. , Social@KeplerHomes will continue to cover and focus on users operating different social apps in the subsequent update process. Although the above requires time and phased focus, Twitter is something we can quickly cover at the moment.






Social@KeplerHomes will use 30% of the Social protocol revenue to give back to KeplerHomes Presale supporters to thank them for their support and trust in KeplerHomes. At the same time, 10% of the income from the planning arrangement agreement will be set up to be allocated as an incentive contract and deployed in Arbitrum.

Justification for the size of the grant:

From March 2023 to June 2023, KeplerHomes AirdropBox for Arbitrum Odyssey users received extensive attention and participation from Arbitrum users.






KEPLER NFT ON Arbitrum’s data performance to date:


Kepler PFP NFT, number of claims: 8,008 – holders: 6,308

 and Arbitrum ecosystem.


Regarding Social@KeplerHomes’ assistance and expected contribution to the Arbitrum ecosystem, please see the details above and will not go into details here.


Execution Strategy:


If the KeplerHomes grant is approved, ARB tokens will be sent to the reward contract address

The specific execution plan is as follows:


KeplerHomes NFT MarketPlace Transaction Mining Rewards


(KeplerHomes provides AirdropBoxKey with advanced attributes. Supplementary explanation: The NFT market is subject to the influence of the general environment, and liquidity has become increasingly low. It is undeniable that NFT assets are important assets other than ERC20 in Arbitrum & games, and users are encouraged to trade NFT assets. It is of great significance to the Arbitrum ecology)


Top 20 users by trading volume

(10K ARB/week, lasting for 12 weeks, total 120K ARB reward)


1st Place – 3,000 ARB

2nd Place – 1,500 ARB

3rd place – 600 ARB

4th-20th place - 300 ARB


Users who click Offer and have top 20 trading volume

(10K ARB/week, lasting for 12 weeks, total 120K ARB reward)


1st Place – 3,000 ARB

2nd Place – 1,500 ARB

3rd place – 600 ARB

4th-20th place - 300 ARB

Randomly reward 8K ARB to the top 200 traders by trading volume every week - 40%






Weekly trading points TOP 200 ranking 6K ARB - 30%

Grant Timeline:

The above-mentioned contract reward activities began to be implemented to reward users shortly after KeplerHomes received funding from Arbitrum.






120K ARB is used to guide KEPL-LP liquidity incentives

(which will last for 4 weeks after the 8-week incentive event) and end simultaneously with the overall event

SECTION 5: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Provide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.


Is the protocol native to Arbitrum? :


KeplerHomes is not a native Arbitrum protocol, but Arbitrum is a primary target at both the development and operations levels. Due to the characteristics of the product itself, there is a very large demand for user growth indicators, so from the beginning KeplerHomes was designed from the perspective of multi-chain

4. WBTC           30,000     10%      0x51Ff97d92683992AD091E04470069bB942219D71



Funding Address: 
0x75fb824cd7ad7C0cB39A23c6DF22DBa942A67f3E


Funding Address Characteristics: The address above is for a ⅔ gnosis safe. Each private key is held by a different member of the prime protocol team, and has not been shared anywhere. The signer wallets (and private keys) will only be used for managing grants from Arbitrum.


Contract Address: Should we receive the grant funds, we will deploy the contract to distribute grant funds. The contracts have already been used on other chains for distribution of grant funds successfully, and we can deploy ahead of time on Arbitrum if that is necessary.


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives: Grow TVL and DAUs on Arbitrum. Bring new users from Prime users in other ecosystems onto Arbitrum as active users.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):




Arbitrum TVL on incentivized and non-incentivized markets.


Deposit and borrow rates on incentivized markets


Arbitrum DAUs




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:




Introducing New Assets and Liquidity Streams:




Prime Protocol’s cross-chain capabilities allow for the seamless integration of assets from various blockchains. This bridges diverse ecosystems, allowing the Arbitrum community to access a wider pool of assets and liquidity without having to sell or exchange their holdings. Furthermore, attractive yields on Prime can serve as an educational tool, informing the Arbitrum community about the benefits and possibilities of leveraging assets on other chains without divesting their Arbitrum positions.




Attracting Users from Various Chains to Explore Yields on Arbitrum:




Prime Protocol’s cross-chain capabilities can bolster participation from users of other blockchains in Arbitrum’s DeFi markets. By leveraging these features, users from different blockchains might find Arbitrum’s ecosystem appealing, especially when they learn about lucrative yield farming opportunities available. Prime’s environment can present such opportunities more transparently to users from other chains, thus driving increased participation.


For example, consider a user who holds BNB tokens on BNB chain. However, they’ve noticed that there are a number of novel protocols on Arbitrum that they would like to use. Prime allows this user to use their BNB as collateral to borrow USDC on Arbitrum, and deploy those tokens into other Arbitrum native protocols. Prime Protocol’s cross-chain capabilities open up exciting possibilities for users of any ecosystem who want to easily access Arbitrum’s DeFi markets, generating greater participation and interoperability within the ecosystem.






Sustainable Growth:




Prime Protocol’s cross-chain approach guarantees both rapid and enduring growth of the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem. Thanks to the protocol’s seamless cross-chain compatibility, individuals from any ecosystem can borrow Arbitrum assets on Prime, instantly gaining access to Arbitrum without any prior chain interaction. This revolutionary onboarding opportunity eliminates the need for users to bridge funds or incur slippage fees in order to access a new ecosystem, thus making user acquisition and growth easier than ever before.




Reinforcing Arbitrum’s Role in the DeFi World:




Arbitrum plays a major role in DeFi as the leading Layer 2 blockchain in crypto. This has become especially important with the rise of user interest in L2 solutions, and Arbitrum has cemented itself as one of the powerhouse ecosystems in the space. Prime Protocol will use this grant to help onboard new users to the chain, boost TVL, and increase user engagement on the chain.


Justification for the size of the grant:

This grant size will be enough to sustain approximately 5-6 million for four months.


Execution Strategy:


Rather than deploy the full amount linearly over four months, we will be judicious in ramping up the APR on markets to ensure that we are meeting our objective of bringing in new users to the protocol and Arbitrum. This ensures that we are not giving all the incentives to existing users without achieving our objectives. Each week, we will evaluate whether the higher yields succeeded in bringing in new users. If they did, and yields have come down as a result, we will increase the incentives until they reach a steady state that can be maintained for the timeline of the grant. However, if yields are still high or if few new users enter the protocol, we will adjust our community outreach approach before increasing incentives further. If all tokens are being farmed by existing whales, we will implement a lockup/vest on the incentives to ensure that farmers are long term believers in Arbitrum.


Grant Timeline: 4 months


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream? Yes


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS

Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?: Prime has been live on Arbitrum since Day 1 of mainnet release. Prime Protocol is cross-chain and now supports 8 blockchains.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?: Prime currently supports Arbitrum, Avalanche, BASE, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Moonbeam, Optimism, and Polygon.


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?: Prime Protocol’s mainnet launched on May 9, 2023.


Protocol Performance:

Prime Protocol has received steady support since launching on Mainnet earlier this year, and recently surpassed $6M of TVL and $2.5M of borrows across the protocol. At the time of writing, the protocol TVL is growing at a weekly rate of 22%. You can see the full timeline of Prime’s growth via DeFiLlama here: 
https://defillama.com/protocol/prime-protocol


Protocol Roadmap:


Currently, the protocol is pursuing development in three main areas: New assets, interoperability, and perpetuals.


New Assets (AAVE aTokens, more liquid staking tokens)




Prime is working to onboard new interest bearing and liquid staking tokens. The protocol already offers cbETH, wstETH, and rETH. However, we are working with oracle providers to offer support for select AAVE aTokens, more liquid staking tokens, and more niche interest bearing collateral.




Perpetuals. Initial launch on Arbitrum




Prime is also planning to add a perpetuals platform. This is a longer term project, and it will initially be deployed exclusively to Arbitrum. The platform will be order-book based and allow users the ability to increase their trading exposure.




LayerZero




Prime is also rolling out support for LayerZero deposits and repays for Arbitrum. We expect this functionality to go live for users early during the grant deployment period (if it is not live already by then).

SECTION 5: Data and Reporting

Is your team prepared to create Dune Dashboards for your incentive program?: Yes, we will create Dune Dashboards to monitor the incentive program and show progress.


Does your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread? Yes, we will provide bi-weekly updates regarding yields, TVL increases, and user activity levels.


Does your team acknowledge that failure to comply with any of the above requests can result in the halting of the program’s funding stream?: Yes"

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives:




Onboard new on-chain users into the Arbitrum options ecosystem


Increase protocol sequencer fees paid to Arbitrum


Jumpstart the Dopex V2 ecosystem: RDPX V2, CLAMM and Options AMM


Solidify Protocol Owned Liquidity(PoL) for the Dopex ecosystem


Provide better bonding incentives for retail users and Arbitrum aligned DAOs




Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):




Monthly Active Users(MAU)


TVL(Product and Protocol side)


RDPX token transactions


Sequencer fees




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


The Dopex protocol has been Arbitrum aligned since day one of the rollup being public. Our main goal is to build an alternative for CEX option markets on-chain while leveraging the composability of defi to build new option primitives. In addition, we will turn the ARB token into a productive asset, some examples are: create arb options markets, margin trading for major assets such as BTC and ETH.


This grant would act as Nitro fuel to bootstrap and solidify the new Dopex option architecture we are building with our V2 ecosystem. RDPX can be bonded to get receipt tokens that represent ETH:DPXETH LPs in a curve pool. This receipt token can be used in our upcoming CLAMM and Option Pools with deep liquidity, instant settlements and a range of option markets for blue chip tokens such as BTC, ETH and ARB as well.


Users who bond their RDPX will help strengthen the protocol liquidity and get rewarded by it with these extra ARB incentives. Same goes for users who LP in our Perpetual Puts and CLAMM LPs.


Justification for the size of the grant:


The 1.5M ARB tokens will be distributed on a 3 month vesting period and will be used to jumpstart defi options activity, increase TVL, engage with DAOS that are willing to delegate into the RDPXV2 bonding system. All this fuel will increase paid on-chain fees therefore bringing in more revenue for the Arb DAO via sequencer fees.


Execution Strategy:


Funds will be used in the following programs:




RDPX V2 Receipt tokens stakers


RDPX V2 Perpetual put vault deposits


Dopex V2 CLAMM LPs




RDPX V2 Receipt tokens stakers:


Users deposit their receipt tokens into the staking contract and receive the additional arb rewards every 2 weeks based on TVL and staking time




Arb amount: 675,000(45% of the grant)


Monthly distribution: 225,000 per month




RDPX V2 Perpetual put vault deposits:


LPs will lock their assets and receive arb rewards based on % share deposited for perp put vault




Arb amount: 225,000(15% of the grant)


Monthly distribution: 75,000 per month




Dopex V2 CLAMM LPs:


Users deposit their CLAMM LPS with us and earn additional ARB rewards based on the TVL/time LPs are locked.




Arb amount: 600,000(40% of the grant)


Monthly distribution: 200,000 per month




The following pools will be incentivized:




ETH/USDC


ARB/USDC


DPX/ETH




Funds will be hold and distributed on the following ⅔ multisig address:

Grant Timeline: [Describe the timeline for the grant]


Based on the distribution schedule, the grant will be distributed in total within 3 months. Growth metrics dashboards will be submitted no later than one week after each month that passes among the various initiatives. After the grant period concludes, Dopex will extensively evaluate the grant’s impact.


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?

Yes

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size:


6,000,000 ARB

(The original size was 9,000,000 ARB, and after learning community opinions, the requested grant size is lowered by 33%.)


Grant Matching:




MUX will use the in-house budget to launch multiple promotional campaigns and onboard more users to the ecosystem.




Grant Breakdown:


MUX plans to use the grant to onboard more organic users to the Arbitrum ecosystem and increase user engagement, trading volume, TVL and transactions.


Tentatively, 55% of the grant will be utilized to reduce trading fees for GMX V1, GMX V2, Gains, and MUX native pool positions opened through the MUX aggregator.


Please note, for the proposed rebates, the rebate rate will be based on the users’ actual fees spent; if the integrated protocols also offer additional rebates/rewards separately, 
MUX will ensure the final total rebates won’t exceed the fees paid
. 
There will be no trade-to-earn opportunities during this campaign
. In addition, 
MUX contributors will closely monitor and prevent wash trading and Sybil-attack-related activities from this campaign to ensure proper grant usage
; addresses involving wash trading or Sybil-attack-related activities will be published and excluded from receiving the rebates.




Fee rebates



ARB tokens will be distributed as fee rebates to traders weekly on Thursdays UTC based on the fees they spend during the week.


The fee reduction will be applied to all integrated protocols without discrimination.



This covers all markets offered by GMX V1, GMX V2, Gains and MUX native pool.






The rebates that traders can receive won’t exceed the fees they spend on trading. There will be no room for trade-to-earn activities.



The rebate rate will be based on the users’ actual fees spent; if the integrated protocols also offer additional rebates separately, MUX will ensure the final total rebates won’t exceed the fees paid.






The grant spending pacing will depend on organic trading activities during each week.



MUX contributors will closely monitor and prevent wash trading and Sybil-attack-related activities from this campaign.


Addresses involving wash trading or Sybil-attack-related activities will be published and excluded from receiving the rebates. MUX contributors reserve the right to identify any Sybil-attack-related addresses and exclude them from the incentive program.


The anti-wash-trading & anti-Sybil-attack rules will remain unrevealed. Otherwise, the rules can be abused with planned strategies. Just like before a network or protocol launches the airdrop, they announce the Anti-Sybil rules afterward instead of beforehand. This is intentional to ensure the proper grant usage with no wash-trading or Sybil attacks.






Integrated protocol trading fee rates before and after reduction



GMX V1: 0.1% → 0%


GMX V2: 0.05% / 0.07% → 0%


Gains: Crypto 0.08% → 0%; Forex 0.012% / 0.016% / 0.02% → 0%; Commodities 0.05% / 0.08% → 0%


MUX Native Pool: 0.06% → 0%


If more perps trading protocols in the Arbitrum ecosystem are integrated into MUX during the campaign, the fee deduction will be applied to them as well.










Trading competitions & other forms of promotional trading events



Aside from the trading fee rebates, MUX can potentially launch promotional trading events, not limited to trading competitions, based on market sediments and volatility.


The objective is to boost user adoption and trading demand, referencing organic market trends.








Tentatively, 45% of the grant will be utilized to increase yield for the MUX native pools on Arbitrum.




Context



The MUX native pool currently has the 
3rd highest TVL
 in the on-chain perps trading sector. Over 80% of the MUX native pool TVL is on Arbitrum.


In addition, the aggregator has also integrated with the GLP pool, GM pools and gDAI vault to offer the currently deepest aggregated liquidity in the on-chain perps sector for traders.


However, when trading demand surges, the open interest caps can still be reached across all integrated protocols, limiting traders to opening more needed positions.






MUXLP stakers currently earn 
#RealYield
 in the form of $ETH tokens weekly from protocol income. By offering additional $ARB token incentives for LPs, the pool size can increase to support more trading demand and initiate a flywheel effect with the trading incentives.




The grant allocation ratio for trading and liquidity incentives is tentative and can be adjusted based on performance.




If the trading demand and trading fees surge more than expected, more incentives will be allocated toward the trading side to ensure 0% trading fees for all integrated protocols.


If the liquidity cannot support enough trading demand and guarantee optimized trading experiences, more incentives will be allocated toward the liquidity side.


The incentive mechanism can be adjusted accordingly to ensure the most efficient usage and results for accelerating user adoption.

MUX has integrated with three leading perps protocols regarding TVL and organic trading volume in the Arbitrum ecosystem: GMX (V1 & V2), Gains and MUX native pool. Users can freely choose preferred protocols for opening needed positions, or the aggregator can automatically select the most suited liquidity source based on market, available liquidity, and trading cost. As a result, MUX has onboarded a community of web3 native traders to Arbitrum and contributed a notable amount of organic volume to integrated protocols in the ecosystem.


Currently, DEX to CEX futures trading volume is between 
1% - 2% daily
 The trading cost is the one key factor constraining trader acquisition for perpetual DEXes, as the typical fee rate range on CEXes is 0.02% - 0.05%, while the standard fee rate range on DEXes is 0.05% - 0.1%. As the trading experiences and features on perp DEXes advance, the higher trading cost is still a barrier for more traders to onboard.


1600×576 81.7 KB


Arbitrum is the epicenter of perp DEX innovations; 
5 of the top 6 perp dexes in TVL
 are currently deployed on Arbitrum. If the trading cost barrier can be crossed for a decent amount of time, the Arbitrum ecosystem can accelerate user adoption and onboard more traders from other web3 and web2 ecosystems.


In addition, a notable number of yield farming protocols have integrated with GLP, GM, gDAI and MUXLP. Boosting trading volume for the integrated protocols on the MUX aggregator will help increase the yield for related pools and can potentially onboard more LPs.


The MUX native pool currently has the 
3rd highest TVL
 in the on-chain perps trading sector. Over 80% of the MUX native pool TVL is on Arbitrum. In addition, the aggregator has also integrated with the GLP pool, GM pools and gDAI vault to offer the currently deepest aggregated liquidity in the on-chain perps sector for traders. However, when trading demand surges, the open interest caps can still be reached across all integrated protocols, limiting traders to opening more needed positions. By offering additional $ARB token incentives for LPs, the pool size can increase to support more trading demand and initiate a flywheel effect with the trading incentives.


Justification for the size of the grant:


The campaign duration is estimated to be 4 months.


For the trading incentive: MUX plans to use the grant to directly rebate trading fees for traders, the contributors estimated the grant size based on the organic trading fees that the MUX aggregator generated for all integrated protocols in the past 4 months.


Between June 21 and September 21, the total organic trading volume on MUX was $5.63B, and the trading fees generated for integrated protocols were over $4M. The volume and income were generated without offering any forms of trading incentives, proving MUX aggregator’s proper product-market-fit and organic user base. If the fees can be further lowered through rebates, we can reasonably expect the aggregator to onboard more traders from other ecosystems. MUX contributors used the metrics as a reference and wished to reduce the trading fees with the grant to accelerate trader adoption.


Regarding liquidity incentives, the MUX native pool currently offers a significant portion of protocol income through $ETH tokens and additional $MUX token incentives for LPs. The APR has been between 15% - 50% in the past four months. The MUX native pool TVL reached over $60M at its peak because of the high yield. Through offering additional $ARB token incentives for LPs, the pool size can increase to support more trading demand and initiate a flywheel effect with the trading incentives.


Execution Strategy:




MUX contributors will add a trading fee rebate distribution setup to the Dapp.



All trading fees that traders spend on any integrated protocols (currently GMX V1, GMX V2, Gains and MUX native pool) during the campaign will be tracked.


MUX aggregator will distribute trade fee rebates to traders weekly on Thursdays in the form of $ARB tokens.


Upon distribution, the number of ARB tokens rebated is calculated based on traders’ weekly trading fees and the real-time ARB token price.






MUX contributors will closely monitor and prevent wash trading and Sybil-attack-related activities from this campaign and ensure the proper usage of funds.



Addresses involving wash trading or Sybil-attack-related activities will be published and excluded from receiving the rebates.






Distributed rebates will be entirely based on the organic trading fees that traders spent during the week.



The grant spending pacing will depend on organic trading activities during each week.


If all approved grants are spent before January 31, 2023, the campaign will end early.


If the approved grants are not fully spent before January 31, 2023, the remaining grant will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO.






If MUX does launch additional promotional trading events during the campaign, MUX dev contributors will develop needed setups for the events.


For liquidity incentives, $ARB incentives will be added to the rewards composition.


MUX contributors will launch multiple marketing campaigns using the in-house marketing budget to promote this campaign and accelerate trader adoption for the Arbitrum ecosystem.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size:


812,600 ARB


Grant Matching:


Webacy does not currently have a token.


Grant Breakdown:


Grant will be used to incentivize signup and consistent use of Webacy services and safe user activity on the Arbitrum network. We will be leveraging the grant to reward users for being safe on chain, which includes activities like setting up wallet monitoring, checking their risk score and approvals, and overall not getting hacked in a certain timeframe.


User rewards will vary depending on the level of safety they have achieved on the Webacy platform as well as the duration they have remained safe.


Support for the Arbitrum network on Wallet Watch is already complete, which means we can begin the incentive program immediately after passing of the proposal.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives:


Bring Webacy’s Safety Suite to the Arbitrum ecosystem and promote safe activity in the network:


Webacy now serves over 30k users globally, has over $150M in assets under monitoring, and sends over 300k notifications via e-mail and SMS per month. Our tools and services have been well-received by self-custodied users on Ethereum, and now we’re looking to bring these advanced safety tools to Arbitrum!


The objective of this grant is to incentivize users to utilize our services to safely interact on the Arbitrum network. Our plan is to reward regular users of our services with Arbitrum tokens for staying safe over a certain period of time, similar to how auto insurance companies now reward safe drivers. The incentive will only be for users that leverage Webacy services on the Arbitrum network.


100% of the grant will be distributed as user rewards.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):


Our two main near term objectives:






3k users monitoring wallets on Arbitrum / 10k notifications a month specifically for Arbitrum






5-10M in asset value monitored on the Arbitrum network






Longer term objectives:






15k users monitoring wallets on Arbitrum / 100k notifications a month specifically for Arbitrum






Integration of Webacy’s Risk Score APIs with major Arbitrum compatible dApps






Webacy’s Wallet Watch used to monitor all Arbitrum developers and their teams wallets






100M in asset value monitored on the Arbitrum






Natively recommended product to all Arbitrum developers and users






How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?






While L2s natively offer robust safety tools from an infrastructure level, the issues and UI concerns of self-custody still remain. Webacy’s safety tools transcend chains, and we hope to bring our impact to Arbitrum’s robust communities. Users must feel safe to freely interact with projects, tools, and tokens, and our services enable this freedom.






Our APIs empower teams to bring safety to their platform before it’s too late. Not only can teams project their projects internally through our real-time monitoring services, but they can raise safety insights to their end-users to inform them on where their assets are going, what they’re interacting with, and when to be safe rather than sorry.






This grant will allow us to spread the word of Webacy’s safety services by incentivizing users to sign up, utilize, and stay consistent with best security practices.






This grant also will empower us to bring safety engineering into the Arbitrum ecosystem which helps improve public perception of user safety and security on blockchain products. This will enable more non-Web3 native users to eventually feel comfortable interacting on arbitrum as they become more accustomed to consumer-facing blockchain dapps.






Justification for the size of the grant:


In order to properly incentivize users to take action to improve their crypto security, the reward needs to be sizable enough to compel users to act. With the amount of users we’d like to reach in our short term and long term goals, the size of the grant will allow us to give each user a sizable reward, with the amount of the reward ranging depending on specific factors (i.e. usage, activity, consistency, etc.)


Execution Strategy:






Reward size per user will rely on a combination of things, both to verify that real users are the ones being rewarded, as well as confirming that the activity taking place is valid and leading the user towards better security. Metrics to determine reward size per user will include data like: how many wallets the user has monitored through Wallet Watch on Arbitrum network, how much value each of those wallets holds, how frequently the wallet receives notifications through Wallet Watch (aka how active is the wallet) among others. We can provide the exact details of the algorithm to the grant team upon request.






After the initial loading period (give users time to sign up and set up wallet monitoring), distribution of rewards will be tiered based on the reward size algorithm that we’ve created, including a factor of time. The longer users are utilizing Webacy Wallet Watch, the greater their reward.






We’ll set up monitoring and dashboarding as an extension of our systems to be able to track the progress of users and share feedback on the execution of the grant proposal.






We’ll continue marketing, integration, and co-branding efforts with other projects in the ecosystem to ensure that the proposal is a success and more users on the Arbitrum ecosystem are set up with the safety tools they need.






Grant Timeline:


We estimate that the implementation process will take around 3 months (prior to 31 January 2024):




Determination of how the rewards will be distributed, and what triggers will contribute to higher / lower rewards (1 week)


Building the tracking, dashboarding, and dapp changes necessary to monitor progress (2-3 weeks)


Crafting the marketing and launch plan for the incentivisation process, including reach-outs to partners, agreements, and any integrations that might be necessary (2-3 weeks)


Launch – longer duration of safe practice may result in higher rewards, which is why the 3 month range was given. For example, we may give a higher reward for users that can go an entire year without getting hacked, vs someone who just sets up wallet monitoring.




Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?


Yes




SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:


Webacy is a multichain application.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?:


We’re also exploring support for Polygon and Optimism for our smart contract product (Panic Button, Backup Wallet). Our Wallet monitoring product is already compatible with Polygon, Optimism, and Ethereum Mainnet.


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?:


Our Wallet Watch feature is deployed in beta for Arbitrum wallet monitoring since September 14, 2023


Protocol Performance:


We currently serve over 30k users, have 150M in assets monitored, and send over 300k notifications per month. We expect this to grow with the introduction of support for new chains.


Protocol Roadmap:


In addition to adding support for more chains, we’re excited to continue to add value to our users by enhancing our current feature set. Our notifications will become more robust and informational. Webacy’s Risk Score is enhanced daily through new data sources, models, and algorithms, bringing the most cutting edge risk mitigation information to the space. We’re also in the R&D phase of multiple exciting new developments within safety and self-custody using technologies like ERC 4337 and ERC 6900.

Funding Address Characteristics: 3/5 Safe - controlled by Silo Finance’s core team


Contract Address:


The core team will deploy a new incentive controller similar to (arb1:0x4999873bF8741bfFFB0ec242AAaA7EF1FE74FCE8) that distributes $SILO incentives to lending markets.


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives
:


Our primary objective of the grant is to stimulate deposits and utilization of existing markets, while focusing on creating sustainable network effects around deposits that do not rely on long-term incentives.


We believe there are dozens of token assets, including new stablecoins and derivative assets, that need lending markets as part of their growth cycle.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
:


To track success, we will use three primary metrics:




Borrowed TVL in existing lending markets


Borrowed TVL in newly-launched lending markets




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?


We believe Arbitrum can benefit in four major areas:




Security-First Lending: Silo allows users to modulate risk on a per-asset basis by allowing lenders to select what collateral can be used to borrow their tokens. This means users can personally control their risk exposure and conduct safe lending practices.


Lending Markets for All Tokens: By design, Silo Finance can create lending markets for any token assets. Our commitment to this goal is evident in our support for tokens such as $rDPX, $JONES, and $PREMIA etc. that are not available elsewhere.


Attracting TVL: Lending markets in themselves drive capital efficiency by giving users access to liquidity without losing exposure to their tokens. By incentivizing TVL on Silo Finance, we aim to drive deep lending liquidity that will contribute to the growth of Arbitrum TVL and its user base.




Justification for the size of the grant:


Silo Finance was the first lending protocol to launch a lending market for the $ARB token. To date, the SiloDAO has streamed over 1M $SILO (> ~$65,000 then) to the $ARB lending market, building the deepest isolated lending market for the token with $6M TVL across $ARB/$ETH/$USDC.e.


The $SILO incentive program covers other isolated lending markets such as GMX, DPX, wstETH, and rETH. This program is financed by SiloDAO and has contributed significantly to creating deep lending markets that see consistent utilization of deposited funds.


1M $ARB will allow us to scale lending both horizontally and vertically by creating new lending markets as well as increasing activities in existing ones.


Execution Strategy:


100% allocated to incentivizing deposit/borrow actions in 16 isolated lending markets that meet the following criteria:




Resilient oracles for all underlying assets in the market


Sufficient DEX liquidity




Read the distribution framework 
here
.


We will stream bi-weekly incentives to users depositing/borrowing passively.


Any $ARB that is not distributed will be returned to the Arbitrum Foundation.


Grant Timeline
:

We plan to distribute the incentives linearly over 3.5 months period, starting October 15, 2023 and ending January 31, 2024.


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?

Yes


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Provide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:


Silo Finance was initially launched on Ethereum Mainnet. SiloDAO is set to launch Silo V2 on Arbitrum first to become an Arbitrum native protocol.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?:


Ethereum


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?: [Date of deployment]


8 February 2023


Protocol Performance:


1600×1112 198 KB


Silo v1.1 was launched in August 2022 on Ethereum Mainnet and has a secondary mainnet deployment known as Silo Llama as well as Silo Arbitrum. Our total TVL across all markets is $98m with $15.3m TVL on Arbitrum alone.


Since our deployment on Arbitrum, we have grown to be the largest risk-isolated lending market for $ARB with $6.4m TVL. Additionally, we have supported the launch of lending markets for Arbitrum-native tokens such as $MAGIC, $Y2K, $JONES, and $PREMIA which are not available on other platforms.


We have integrated lending market support for Curve LP tokens on Silo Ethereum and believe Arbitrum is home to a broad range of composable products where similar integrations would be suitable - this could include markets for GMX and Camelot LP tokens. Silo has also been used as the base layer lending market for other Arbitrum protocols including FactorDAO and Nitro Cartel.


Silo currently runs a co-incentive program on Silo Arbitrum where we match incentives from partner protocols such as Dopex, GMX, and Gainstrade. Incentives have played a key part in the success of our Arbitrum deployment and we believe a grant will allow us to drive deep lending liquidity and capital efficiency for the ecosystem as a whole.


Protocol Roadmap:


Silo V2 is an upcoming upgrade to the Silo protocol scheduled for Q4 with plans to deploy on Arbitrum first. It is a reconceptualization of the original Silo design that will maintain our risk-isolated architecture while supporting a more extensive variety of tokens and significantly improving capital efficiency. It also includes a veSILO tokenomics upgrade allowing locked $SILO to vote for $SILO emissions gauges on Arbitrum.


We regularly release new markets for tokens and are proud to say we are the only protocol that has a market for $rDPX, $rETH, $GNS, $JONES, $PREMIA, and $Y2K. As the Arbitrum ecosystem grows, we will happily extend support for all suitable tokens.

Applicant Name:


unshETH Core Team


Project Name:


unshETH


Project Description


The unshETH protocol is a novel DeFi primitive that promotes validator decentralization by fostering competition among ETH liquid staking protocols with the aim of bringing the best ETH staking experience to millions of users. The unshETH Ether token represents a diversified liquid staked ETH basket that earns both Ethereum staking rewards and swap fees generated by the unshETH vdAMM, all wrapped in a single ERC-20 token. This innovative token/protocol design unlocks the highest “real yield” opportunity  for DeFi users. unshETH’s native real yield that users earn simply by holding the token is:


unshETH Real Yield APR = ETH Staking APR + Swap Fee APR + Mint/Redeem Fee APR


unshETH Ether is also an Omnichain token that can be transferred seamlessly across ETH Mainnet, BNB Chain, and Arbitrum via LayerZero. This means that just by holding unshETH, on Arbitrum or any other chain, a user will experience higher yields than natively staking or holding standard Ethereum liquid staking tokens.

1280×278 33.8 KB


The successful launch of the unshETH protocol, and expansion across multiple networks, has been beneficial not only to users but also to liquid staking protocols themselves. By participating/collaborating with unshETH LSD protocols are able to tap into the most incentive-efficient method of acquiring “sticky” TVL and capital-efficient on-chain liquidity currently available in Defi.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size:


375,000 ARB


Grant Breakdown:


This grant will be used to enhance the unshETH protocol’s existing incentive programs on the Arbitrum network. To date $300,000 worth of USH tokens have been allocated for incentives on Arbitrum, to good effect. The ARB tokens requested now will be allocated to the most highly effective current incentive programs, such as farm rewards for single sided unshETH, pool rewards on Arbitrum DEXs’ for liquidity for unshETH-ETH, as well to new high-value liquidity pool rewards and new collaborative incentive programs with partner protocols to encourage adoption of unshETH and advance the nascent LSDfi ecosystem on Arbitrum. The unshETH protocol will allocate an additional 1,000,000 USH tokens for use as incentives on Arbitrum, to be distributed alongside the ARB token grant.


The proposed incentive program can be broken down into three categories:




Incentives distributed via the unshETH protocol dAPP






Incentives directed to single-sided unshETH dAPP farm. When first launched on Arbitrum, unshETH quickly gained $3m staked ETH tvl bridged into Arbitrum via incentivizing this farm. This TVL has remained “sticky” and is now the protocol’s most incentive-efficient program. It is believed that dual ARB and USH incentives will result in $5-10M in interest-bearing ETH tvl being bridged into the Arbitrum ecosystem and deposited here.


Incentives directed to unshETH dAPP farms for other unshETH protocol offerings. Including 
reshETH
, 
vdUSH
, and future deployments.






Incentives distributed via DEX protocols for liquidity mining






Incentives directed to unshETH-ETH liquidity providers. It is believed that dual ARB and USH incentives will result in $3M in liquidity across this pair being made available to traders on Arbitrum (removing the need to pay high gas fees to bridge from mainnet) and enable the next round of unshETH token integrations into partner protocols which require on-chain liquidity.


Incentivizes directed to a net-new unshETH-ARB liquidity pool. Part of unshETH’s commitment to supporting the Arbitrum ecosystem.


Incentives directed to various net-new unshETH-[gov_token] pools in collaboration with ecosystem partner protocols to establish unshETH as a performant base layer asset for liquidity on Arbitrum.






Incentives distributed via current and future non-dex partner protocols dAPPs

How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:




Bringing LSTs to Arbitrum




unshETH has played a pivotal role in bringing Liquidity Staking Tokens (LSTs) to the Arbitrum Ecosystem. Starting in Q2 2023, unshETH successfully facilitated the integration of 
Swell’s swETH and Ankr’s ankrETH
 into the Arbitrum ecosystem, allowing millions of users to access these assets for the first time. Building upon these achievements, unshETH is poised to launch 
Stader’s ETHx
 on the platform just two months after its launch. This deployment, scheduled in the upcoming weeks, will make ETHx readily available to Arbitrums vast user base, extending its reach to millions of Arbitrum users.


Update 10/4: It has been exciting to see that since unshETH published this proposal there has been a notable increase in bridging and usage of unshETH ETH on Arbitrum. Over the past week the TVL of unshETH on Arbitrum has increased by over $1 million, hitting an all-time high, and the percentage of all unshETH ETH being held on Arbitrum has also hit an all-time high.

Growing the Arbitrum User Base




unshETH is dedicated to harnessing the incentives available to us in the most effective manner, with the goal of expanding the user base within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Since the launch of unshETH on Arbitrum, the protocol successfully accrued over $1 million in on-chain liquidity over a span of four months. While this initial liquidity growth showed promise, it eventually reached a point of stagnation due to diminishing rewards. However, it is worth noting that once users have experienced the remarkable power and efficiency of the Arbitrum ecosystem, they have been inclined to remain within it rather than returning to Ethereum or bridging to other networks.


We hold a strong belief that by offering additional incentives, we can not only bolster the liquidity of unshETH but also attract more users and foster sustained sticky liquidity within the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Replacing ETH with yield bearing staked ETH throughout Arbitrum Defi through unsETH




While unshETH Ether is the second most liquid form of staked ETH on Arbitrum after Lido wstETH, most ETH on Arbitrum is not natively yield-bearing. We believe that with this grant, we can increase the proportion of ETH on Arbitrum that is staked and yield-bearing. Furthermore, with the recent deployment of our first price-oracle, developed by DIA specifically for Arbitrum, we aspire to diversify the asset offerings available to Arbitrum users, enriching their experience within the ecosystem. Combined with the fact that a significant portion of our ARB grant would be used to incentivize partner protocols, as well as our matching the grant with 1M USH tokens, we believe this will result in a rising tide that lifts all boats, as using other Defi protocols on Arbitrum such as DEXs and lending protocols on Arbitrum becomes more attractive.




Increasing ARB liquidity




As part of growing unshETH, we not only hope to bring users to the Arbitrum ecosystem but increase ARB liquidity. Through incentivising the unshETH-ARB pair we aim to increase ARB liquidity for users in the Arbitrum ecosystem. We believe through this grant we are not only encouraging greater participation but also enhancing the overall liquidity and stability of the complete ecosystem. This, in turn, will spur further adoption of Arbitrum-based solutions.


Justification for the size of the grant:


The unshETH core team identified the grant request size proposed here after reviewing and analyzing it’s past past incentives programs. From that review a plan for the most efficacious future incentive program, enabled by this grant and a further allocation of 1,000,000 USH tokens, was derived. We believe that the projected total impact for Arbitrum Defi is well worth it.


For reference, our previous liquidity mining programs:






BSC: ~$300K in USH token incentives distributed to grow unshETH TVL over 6 months.






Arbitrum: ~$300K in USH token incentives spent over last 4 months.






We believe strongly that the similarly sized grant requested in this proposal will supercharge growth further and enable deeper integration in the Arbitrum ecosystem over the next 4 month. It’s our understanding that based on the recommended guidelines for grant proposals and our history of achieving $4M in TVL and >4 months live on Arbitrum, the maximum unshETH protocol would qualify for is a 750,000 ARB token grant. We believe maximum per-token effectiveness for our incentive program sits at a much lower grant amount of 375,000 tokens.


Execution Strategy:


The funds will be handled by unshETH’s core team to provide incentives as described earlier. To recap, the rewards will be distributed through 3 main channels:






Farm rewards for unshETH ETH staking via the unshETH protocol






Pool rewards on Arbitrum DEXs for unshETH-ETH liquidity and other pools required to support expanded liquidity availability and integrations.






Rewards emitted via partner protocols on Arbitrum to bootstrap and/or accelerate new and exciting integrations






Planned and existing partnerships:






1. Lending and LSDfi: Pendle, Savvy, Dolomite, Abracadabra, Rodeo, Timeswap, Gravita, Equilibrium
2. Perpetuals: Unidex, GMX v2, HMX, Vertex
3. DEX’s: Camelot, Trader Joe, Arrakis, Pancakeswap, Balancer/Aura

How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?


This grant is a crucial factor in achieving our core goal of establishing Arbitrum as a premier hub for bot trading, characterized by exceptional customization, Discord integration, and Rust-based innovation. We have partnered with some of the top protocols on Arbitrum from the beginning, and plan to keep fostering growth within the ecosystem. We were one of the first members of the Camelot round table, worked directly with FactorDao to drive USDC from other chains into their Camelot sale, as well as handled the Vela token migration from Ethereum and Metis to arbitrum while also utilizing their new API to sport one of the first perp telegram bots. We have been a large contributor to the success of Arbritrum, and plan to keep the ecosystem growing through our innovation.


Justification for the size of the grant:


The grant size we are seeking aligns with our substantial accomplishments within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Relay Chain, as an original recipient of an Arb grant and a native Arbitrum project, has been pivotal in fostering the ecosystem’s growth. Relay Chain boasts a remarkable track record, having facilitated bridging for over 2 years, with more than $1 billion in trading volume, serving 25 chains, 15 bridges, and 31 exchanges, and reaching a peak TVL of over $100 million. These achievements underscore our unwavering commitment to Arbitrum’s success and the effective utilization of grant resources to drive adoption and liquidity.


Additionally, our proposal presents the opportunity for the Arbitrum Foundation to potentially benefit if the high-end projections are achieved. This dual advantage of supporting a proven ecosystem player while potentially gaining from its continued success aligns with our shared goals of growth and sustainability within the Arbitrum community. Together, we look forward to realizing the full potential of this partnership.


Execution Strategy:


The grant funds will drive Arbitrum ecosystem growth by incentivizing transactions, volume, and ecosystem growth, with 75% directed to the Telegram bot and the remaining 25% to Discord. Any unused ARB tokens will return to the Arbitrum Foundation. The trading bot collects a 1% ETH fee on each transaction. That fee will be reimbursed to the trader in the ARB token at equivalent value. Half of the ETH collected will market buy ARB and will be gifted to the Arbitrum Foundation. User rewards, calculated at transaction time, feature a 30-day timelock to allow for proper rewards contract funding.

dForce was among the initial protocols launched on Arbitrum.


dForce has initiated liquidity mining from September 2021 and remains as one of the few protocols consistently offering sustained rewards to drive DeFi lending and borrowing activities on Arbitrum. To date, we have disbursed more than 28 million DF tokens, with a value exceeding $2m, to users on Arbitrum.


We will maintain our commitment to incentivizing Arbitrum users through liquidity mining efforts to draw in more participants. Meanwhile, we believe that a combination of ARB and DF rewards will better motivate participants to further the expansion of both the dForce and Arbitrum ecosystems through various marketing initiatives.

How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
: [Provide details]


With this grant, we aim to:






boost collaboration among projects on Arbitrum through community-driven, incentive-based initiatives. We will offer liquidity mining incentives and marketing support for projects that integrate or collaborate with dForce, in the form of liquidity mining rewards, grants, or bootstrapping liquidity.






increase the adoption of USX and bolster the robustness of the Arbitrum ecosystem. For instance, dForce DAO has recently greenlit the use of Rocket Pool’s rETH as collateral on Arbitrum. This move is geared towards providing users with options among various LSD assets (wstETH, rETH, etc) to better align with their investment approaches, and boost liquidity for various LSD assets across the Arbitrum ecosystem.






onboard more users from other blockchains. This ARB grant will augment the existing DF liquidity mining program to provide a modest interest rate that promotes sustainable growth, aiming to encourage users to make their initiate move to Arbitrum.






Additionally, we plan to introduce real yield to USX holders on Arbitrum by onboarding high quality Real-World Assets (RWA) as collateral to mint USX. This will enable users to leverage DeFi’s efficiency and composability while tapping into real yields within the Arbitrum ecosystem.


We also plan to implement sUSX (Saving USX), a new feature that enables USX holders to generate a steady passive income in USX. This systemic interest will be sourced from various avenues, including RWA. We envision to bring the most accessible RWA real yield to Arbitrum users.


Justification for the size of the grant
: [Enter explanation]


The grant will be utilized for a measured and focused incentive campaign to ward off short-term capital.


dForce will focus on enhancing USX’s adoption by both unlocking more use cases and yield avenues for Arbitrum users, and disbursing rewards through liquidity mining to eligible participants.


Execution Strategy
: [Describe the plan for executing including resources, products, use of funds, and risk management. This includes allocations for specific pools, eligible assets, products, etc.]


ARB grant will be utilized to reward activities around USX (integration, lending, trading, etc) on both dForce and other DeFi protocols across the Arbitrum ecosystem.


The rewards will be distributed with our battle-tested staking contract and grant.


The deployment will focus on USX/USDC pools targeting deepen liquidity, Vaults holding LSD assets, and boosting the adoption of these assets on Arbitrum. Additionally, on the lending front, incentives will be provided for USX, USDC, USDT, and DAI liquidity.


Grant Timeline
: [Describe the timeline for the grant]






Liquidity mining: rewards will be disbursed in a linear fashion (i.e., 3-month) to eligible participants.






Partnerships and integrations with dForce will be assessed individually and disbursed through various marketing campaigns, including liquidity mining or other co-incentivizing initiatives to end users.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives:


Our goals for this grant include increasing the number of daily Arbitrum users, its TVL, user retention, capital efficiency, and overall ecosystem Defi metrics. Our main aim is to attract liquidity to the Wombat ecosystem on Arbitrum by offering simplified access, increased returns, and voting/bribes on top of the hyper-capital-efficient concentrated liquidity provided by Wombat. Being built on top of Wombat, Wombex enhances any kind of user acquisition strategy carried out by Wombat.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):


The following key performance indicators will be used to measure the success of this grant:




Total Value Locked - the total amount of stablecoins, LSTs, and other pegged assets (is USD equivalent) deposited into Wombat via Wombex on Arbitrum


Number of Liquidity Providers - the number of users who provide liquidity to Wombat pools via Wombex on Arbitrum


Daily Unique Users - the amount of unique addresses that interact with Wombex contracts on Arbitrum each day




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


We expect that this grant will lead to an increase in the number of users interacting with Wombex on Arbitrum based on the following factors:


Novel application as a source of yield for LPs


Liquidity providers in the ecosystem (here we refer to EVM compliant multi-chain ecosystems including L1s and scaling solutions) are yield seekers. The ability to provide a full range of concentrated liquidity without manual intervention is a universal product targeting a wide audience of DeFi users and LPs (this statement refers to Wombat). Taking into account Wombex yield aggregation, it creates a perfect synergy, providing advanced enhanced returns to LPs and making liquidity provision to the novel AMM (Wombat) using Wombex even more attractive. The key features are competitive returns with relatively low IL risks, simplicity of liquidity provision and position management (LP doesn’t need to manage it at all), and additional revenue sources such as the possibility to participate in bribes.


Real use cases


Wombex creates an efficient yield layer on top of Wombat that offers use cases focused on stablecoins and LSTs. As these types of assets hold the highest volume and TVL projects in DeFi today, providing liquidity that generates yield is one of the most natural use cases for end users. Coupled with Wombat’s capital efficient algorithm that provides attractive terms for both users (low slippage) and LPs (high returns) on swaps with lower liquidity than competitors, it makes a perfect synergy to accelerate real use cases of Wombat with Wombex. In addition to these simple and efficient real use cases, there are more potential unlocks in developing new applications on top of Wombex, using it as a building block of the yield infrastructure.


By being a part of the Arbitrum Incentive Program, Wombex will be able to attract even more users into the Wombex/Wombat/and Arbitrum ecosystems, enriching them, and making fund-management on Arbitrum even more attractive for users, DAOs, and protocols.


Wombex adds value to the following groups of users:






For liquidity providers.

Wombex offers enhanced rewards for LPs based on several sources of rewards (1) Increased rewards as a result of Wombex’s accumulated veWOM in the Wombat position, providing increased rewards to all Wombex LPs based on Wombat’s boosting algorithm (2) Wombex native tokens (WMX) issued pro-rata on top of the WOM generated by Wombex LPs (3) Any other additional tokens provided by Wombat or its partner projects as rewards (4) Arbitrum grant rewards.






For traders (swap users)

Wombex doesn’t provide swap services directly to traders. However, Wombex contributes significantly to the liquidity of the Wombat markets as a significant portion of TVL is deposited through Wombex. Thus, Wombex contributes to better swap conditions for traders.






For stablecoin/LST protocols and products

Wombex provides additional incentives and yield for depositing liquidity to Wombat, contributing to the secondary market






For other yield-generation platforms

Wombex provides an opportunity to integrate yield trading solutions on top of it such as Pendle or similar.






Justification for the size of the grant:


Such an innovative product as Wombat (a DEX built on top of a brand new AMM algorithm with veTokenomics aimed at user loyalty and retention) needs a solid symbiotic project that will provide enhanced returns, veToken aggregation, and bribery services.


Wombex (the closest references are Convex for Curve and Aura.finance for Balancer) is an essential protocol for Wombat that is built on top of it and focuses on supporting its growth, user/TVL acquisition, veWOM token accumulation, and acts as a blackhole for WOM.


Wombex has been building yield aggregation services on top of Wombat, accelerating its adoption, user acquisition, and retention by means of boosting Wombat yields and engaging governance participation via bribes aggregation and distribution on the BNB chain, Arbitrum, and lately Ethereum. Wombex’s track record includes acquiring 100m+ TVL at ATH and being ranked 
#1
 aggregator in Wombat by all metrics such as TVL, veWOM accumulated, user base, and community.


Operating in the Arbitrum ecosystem, Wombex aims to promote and boost all Wombat new pools and products, such as ordinary, cross-chain, and any other kind of pools that will be launched in the future.


This grant will help us achieve our further goals on Arbtrum of increasing the number of its users, TVL, user retention, capital efficiency, and overall ecosystem DeFi metrics.


The grant will be used for user acquisition incentives, focusing on liquidity provider incentives that will provide stablecoins, LSTs, and pegged assets to Wombat AMM via Wombex on Arbitrum. These incentives will be aimed at our DAO partners who use Wombex for their DAO treasury strategies to move some capital to Arbitrum and start managing DAO funds on Arbitrum in the Wombex/Wombat ecosystems.


This proposed grant amount is consistent with proposals for similar projects in the Arbitrum ecosystem. The grant will be used to incentivize Arbitrum community members, Wombex community members, and DAO/ecosystem partners from the BNB chain to move funds to Arbitrum, use Wombex, and become long-term users of Wombex, Wombat, and Arbitrum.


The 200k ARB tokens would allow Wombex to provide additional incentives on top of regular Wombex incentives for all types of TVL acquisition activities such as providing liquidity to pools and veWOM acquisition on Arbitrum. In addition, Wombat incentives will be captured by Wombex users through yield aggregation. We expect that such an organic layering of incentives is the best way to attract stablecoin and LST holders and establish deep liquidity in Wombat pools on Arbitrum, providing a solid foundation for yield aggregation, pool bribery, and long-term user engagement in Wombex/Wombat/and Arbitrum. The amount of the grant was calculated using the Eligibility and Evaluation Guidelines in Arbitrum’s Short-Term Incentive Program.


Execution Strategy:




The Wombex Arbitrum Bootstrap event is the key event for the future success of the protocol in the Arbitrum ecosystem. For this purpose, we plan to allocate 10% of the grant funds for rewards that will be provided along with Wombex native token rewards, which we believe will provide sufficient amounts of WOM deposited into Wombex-owned veWOM by users to allow Wombex to showcase its best yield aggregation capabilities


Wombat main pool liquidity incentives are targeted at ~4% APR, we plan to use 25% of grant amount to increase it by another 2-3% with the joint funding from Wombex rewards and the grant proceeds, using up to 7-8% in total (claiming Wombat rewards and distributing them to our users).


Wombex is not only a revenue aggregation platform, but also a vote aggregation and governance platform. Therefore, we plan to use a portion of the subsidy (7.5%) to provide additional incentives to active governance participants to motivate long-term user engagement with the Wombex protocol and Arbitrum in general. One of the most important features of a yield aggregation platform such as Wombex is to engage users in governance and convert LPs into governance participants as well. In addition, the wmxWOM/WOM peg is critical to the sustainability of the protocol and the technical ability of users to interact with the protocol in the long term. Based on our understanding of this point, we plan to use a portion of the grant (7.5%) to provide additional rewards for wmxWOM holders and liquidity providers. This should increase the number of interactions with other pools and the longevity of such interactions, thereby greatly increasing the efficiency of the grant spent on rewards in liquidity pools.


Wombex plans to use 25% of the grant for providing additional APRs on Wombat partnership pools on Arbitrum, motivating users to move liquidity from BNB Chain, and building strong long-term relationships with the newly onboarded communities, LPs and projects. In addition, we plan to offer some additional rewards to our partners on Arbitrum who will be approved by the Wombex governance to receive such rewards. The plan is to run joint marketing campaigns with such partners/DAOs to bring their community into the Wombex governance as well as provide liquidity to Wombex from the DAO treasury and DAO related individuals, benefiting Wombex, Wombat and Arbitrum with the new TVL at the same time.


for each category (main pool, cross-chain pools, and partnership pools) the particular value of reward rate variable and share of allocations inside pools on various single-side LP options will be decided by the team or Wombex community


Tokens will be distributed to liquidity providers and Bootstrap event participants via smart-contracts or airdrops confirmed by Dune dashboards

New fund issuance volume




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?


Solv Protocol is going to issue multiple DEFI market making funds to allow the users to earn consistent and appealing returns within a controlled environment characterized by relatively low risk, such as the ongoing open-end GMX with total $20,000,000 capacity:
 https://app.solv.finance/earn/open-fund/detail/2


We have a plan of token emission to make our yield returns more attractive, as well as to bootstrapping the Token Governance; Adding the $ARB will help to consolidate this plan by attracting high value existing Arbitrum users to join us.


Additionally, by Q4 2023, we will deploy a liquidity pool starting from $10,000,000 AUM for the Solv FOF(Fund of Funds), we’re also looking forward to add some $ARB as part of incentives and ideally in 1 year we want to be the best player in this DEFI category on Arbitrum.


Justification for the size of the grant:


Currently we’re rebooting the activities on Arbitrum, and have issued over $3million funds to run DEFI Delta Neutral strategies on top of the native Arbitrum DEFI protocols.


Solv is confident to bring a variety of low risk yield strategies including DEFI and RWA to the Arbitrum ecosystem, with the $150k grant we can drive the product growth by making the yield strategies on Solv more attractive and reaching a new high AUM($30m ~ $60m) by end of March 2024.

Blockin GMX Delta Neutral Pool is our biggest Arbitrum pool at the moment. This pool currently holds $2.7 million in assets(
https://app.solv.finance/earn/open-fund/detail/2
). We have also launched the GMX V2 Delta Neutral Pool, which currently holds $0.3 million in assets(
https://app.solv.finance/earn/open-fund/detail/5
 ). Through these pools, we provide stablecoin yields that are not affected by market price fluctuations for everyone.




Officially launched in 2023, Solv V3 has pioneered the construction of a trustless fund infrastructure based on ERC-3525, and has served over 25,000 investors, with over $150 million raised for funds since the launch. On Arbitrum, we’re confident to reach over $15m AUM in Q3 for the recent open-end GMX fund 
https://app.solv.finance/earn/open-fund/detail/2
 , which will drive the growth of both Solv and Arbitrum in users and TVL.


In the future, Solv V3 is not limited to issuing DEFI marketing making products, but also more LSD, CEFI, TradeFi assets, RWAs, etc.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size
: 1,250,000 $ARB


Grant Matching
: To promote sustainable growth, the Magpie Ecosystem will offer incentives in addition to distributing ARB tokens.


Grant Breakdown
:


Total Grant Allocation: 1,250,000 million ARB tokens


This grant is for Magpie as well as three different SubDAO projects within the Magpie XYZ Ecosystem: Penpie, Radpie, and Campie. 100% of the grant will be used to bolster user participation and community engagement on Arbitrum through Magpie, Penpie, Radpie, and Campie.


Our primary objective is not simply to increase yield. Rather, we have directed 80% of our incentive to blackhole PENDLE/GRAIL/dLP/WOM, aiming to bolster the long-term growth of the associated protocols. We are convinced that by encouraging users to lock in their tokens permanently, we can achieve a sustained positive effect on the ecosystem, which will persist even after the ARB incentive phase ends.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives
:


The primary objective of the grant is to increase the user participation on the network and to support the broader Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem moving forward. Magpie is committed to Wombat Exchange, Penpie is committed to Pendle Finance, Radpie is committed to Radiant Capital, and Campie is committed to Camelot DEX. All the grants will be allocated to enhance the core functionalities of the aforementioned platforms by fostering user participation and engagement through the Magpie XYZ Ecosystem on Arbitrum.


Magpie






Incentivize the conversion of WOM tokens into mWOM on Magpie. This conversion will lead to more veWOM accumulated by Magpie on Arbitrum, which in turn enhances the efficiency of the services provided by Magpie on the network, increasing the awareness of the Arbitrum DeFi space and fostering user adoption. This mechanism also supports the long-term development of Wombat Exchange, as Magpie controls token inflation by locking WOM tokens for the maximum period and extending the lock regularly. Incentivize mWOM/WOM liquidity providers to promote user participation.






By distributing 20% of the received grant for liquidity providers, we encourage users to deposit their assets on Magpie, which can result in higher TVL and more users for the Arbitrum ecosystem. This initiative is set to benefit Wombat Exchange. As Magpie incentivizes liquidity providers for their deposits, it can lead to more user participation and increased liquidity within Wombat, furthering the platform’s development.






Penpie






Encourage the conversion of PENDLE tokens into mPENDLE on Penpie. By doing so, Penpie will gather more vePENDLE on Arbitrum, boosting the effectiveness of the services it offers on the network, elevating the visibility of the Arbitrum DeFi sector and onboarding new users. This strategy also aids in the sustained growth of Pendle Finance, as Penpie manages token inflation by locking PENDLE tokens for the longest duration and consistently renewing the lock. Encourage mPENDLE/PENDLE liquidity providers with incentives to boost user engagement.






By allocating 20% of the granted funds to benefit liquidity providers, we motivate users to deposit their assets on Penpie. This can lead to an increased TVL and attract more participants to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Potentially, this can support Pendle Finance by growing the community of Arbitrum LSD and LST enthusiasts, enhancing liquidity for its users and fostering a more dynamic experience.






Radpie






Promote the conversion of dLP tokens into mdLP on Radpie. Through this mechanism, Radpie will amass more dLP on Arbitrum, enhancing the quality of its network services and elevating the stature of the Arbitrum DeFi landscape, which could attract new long-term users. This system facilitates the sustained expansion of Radiant Capital. Radpie effectively controls token inflation of RDNT by locking dLP tokens for the longest permissible duration within Radiant. mdLP/dLP liquidity providers will get incentives to encourage user participation.






By setting aside 20% of our received grant to reward liquidity providers, we urge users to deposit their assets on Radpie. This could lead to a boost in TVL and an influx of users to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Particularly, this could attract more deposits to Radiant Capital, fostering the platform’s growth moving forward.






Campie






Support the conversion of GRAIL tokens into mGRAIL on Campie. This action amplifies Campie’s presence on Arbitrum, enhancing its services within the ecosystem and drawing in new users. Also, this mechanism empowers Campie to lock GRAIL tokens within Camelot, ensuring control over token inflation and promoting Camelot DEX’s sustained growth. Incentivize mGRAIL/GRAIL liquidity providers to increase user participation.






By allocating 20% of our received grant to liquidity providers, we aim to entice users to stake their assets on Campie, potentially amplifying TVL and enriching the Arbitrum ecosystem with additional participants. Specifically, this can enhance liquidity within Camelot DEX, leading to a more optimized user experience for the Arbitrum Community in the future.

How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
 :


Upon receiving the grant, the Magpie XYZ Ecosystem will use the funds to reward users who contribute to the core functionalities of Magpie, Penpie, Radpie, and Campie, while also supporting the development of Wombat Exchange, Pendle Finance, Radiant Capital, and Camelot DEX. Our design offers both utility and real yield opportunities. The ARB incentives aim to amplify user engagement and fortify the central features of the Magpie XYZ ecosystem, thus enriching the overarching DeFi landscape of Arbitrum via 8 distinct protocols, encompassing Magpie XYZ and the integrated protocols mentioned above.


Magpie


WOM Converters: At the heart of Magpie’s functionalities is the process of locking WOM tokens as veWOM within Wombat Exchange. Users who convert their WOM via Magpie will be eligible for $ARB incentives in recognition of their contributions. This strategy aims to bolster the growth of the Arbitrum Ecosystem by concurrently supporting both Magpie and Wombat Exchange. This mechanism supports the lock-up of WOM tokens, decreasing its circulating supply while optimizing Magpie.


How do we plan to distribute these rewards?




WOM UP Party (Participants can get $ARB tokens as rewards for their conversions)


mWOM Stability Vault (Users who stake their mWOM via the Stability Vault will be able to share $ARB tokens as rewards)


Spin The Wheel (Whenever users convert their WOM into mWOM using this mechanism, we will allow them to spin the wheel to receive ARB rewards. The amount of ARB incentives the user receives depends on the spin result and the amount of WOM they convert.)


mWOM/WOM liquidity providers (By providing liquidity to the mWOM/WOM pair users can get $ARB tokens as rewards.)




Liquidity Providers: Liquidity providers are fundamental for Magpie to have a high revenue of WOM tokens from Wombat Exchange. With the goal of onboarding new users into the Arbitrum Ecosystem and Magpie, liquidity providers will be compensated with a share of $ARB rewards for their contribution to the platform’s long-term sustainability.


How does converting WOM tokens benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem?






Allow liquidity providers to get boosted yields on Magpie without the need to lock WOM tokens themselves. This will attract more risk-averse liquidity providers to Arbitrum, offering a sustainable and efficient source of revenue moving forward.






Provide mWOM holders with boosted revenue share from Magpie as a reward for their long-term support, offering Wombat Exchange users the chance to access more benefits.






Penpie


PENDLE Converters: Central to Penpie’s features is the mechanism of converting PENDLE tokens to vePENDLE within Pendle Finance. Those who convert their PENDLE through Penpie will qualify for $ARB rewards in acknowledgment of their efforts. This approach is designed to enhance the expansion of the Arbitrum Ecosystem while simultaneously backing both Penpie and Pendle Finance.


How do we plan to distribute these rewards?




PENDLE RUSH (Participants can receive $ARB tokens as rewards for their PENDLE conversions.)


mPENDLE Stability Vault (Users who stake their mPENDLE in the Stability Vault will be eligible to receive a share of $ARB tokens as rewards.)


Spin The Wheel (Whenever users convert their PENDLE into mPENDLE using this mechanism, we will allow them to spin the wheel to receive ARB rewards. The amount of ARB incentives the user receives depends on the spin result and the amount of PENDLE they convert.)


mPENDLE/PENDLE liquidity providers (By providing liquidity to the mPENDLE/PENDLE pair users can get $ARB tokens as rewards.)




Liquidity Providers: Liquidity providers play a crucial role in ensuring Penpie garners a substantial revenue in PENDLE tokens from Pendle Finance. Aiming to attract more users to the Arbitrum Ecosystem and Penpie, liquidity providers will receive a portion of $ARB rewards in recognition for their dedication to the platform’s enduring stability. We propose allocating a portion of the funds from this bucket as incentives to direct more PENDLE emissions to Arbitrum pools on Penpie, aiming to enhance the network’s TVL.


How does converting PENDLE tokens benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem?






Liquidity providers can earn higher yields on Penpie without the obligation to lock PENDLE tokens by themselves. This attracts more cautious users to Arbitrum while ensuring a steady source of revenue.






Offer mPENDLE holders an enhanced revenue share from Penpie in recognition of their sustained support, allowing Pendle Finance users to enjoy additional advantages.






Radpie


dLP Converters: At the core of Radpie’s offerings is the accumulation and lock-up of dLP tokens within Radiant Capital. Individuals who convert their dLP to mdLP using Radpie will be rewarded with $ARB incentives for their pivotal role. This methodology is designed to spur the development of the Arbitrum Ecosystem by simultaneously supporting both Radpie and Radiant Capital.


How do we plan to distribute these rewards?




dLP RUSH (Participants can earn $ARB tokens as a reward for converting their dLP.)


mdLP Staking (Users staking their mdLP through Radpie will have the opportunity to split $ARB tokens as rewards.)


mdLP/dLP liquidity providers (By providing liquidity to the mdLP/dLP pair users can get $ARB tokens as rewards.)




Liquidity Providers: Liquidity providers are essential in driving significant revenue for Radpie from Radiant Capital. As Radpie seeks to introduce more users to the Arbitrum Ecosystem, Radpie depositors will receive a slice of $ARB earnings in appreciation for their commitment to the platform’s longevity.


How does converting dLP tokens benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem?






Radiant Capital depositors can optimize their returns on Radpie without needing to lock dLP tokens personally. This approach lures more risk-averse users to Arbitrum and also creates a consistent revenue stream.






Give mdLP holders an increased revenue share from Radpie for their continued support, offering more benefits to Radiant Capital users.






Campie


GRAIL Converters: An integral feature of Campie revolves around the lock-up of GRAIL tokens within Camelot DEX. Users converting their GRAIL tokens to mGRAIL through Campie are poised to receive $ARB rewards in recognition of their role. The overarching strategy is to accelerate the growth of the Arbitrum Ecosystem while simultaneously supporting both Campie and Camelot DEX.


How do we plan to distribute these rewards?




GRAIL RUSH (Participants are eligible for $ARB token rewards upon converting their GRAIL.)


mGRAIL Staking (Users who deposit their mGRAIL on Campie are eligible to receive $ARB token distributions as incentives.)


mGRAIL/GRAIL liquidity providers (By providing liquidity to the mGRAIL/GRAIL pair users can get $ARB tokens as rewards.)




Liquidity Providers: Liquidity providers can serve as a cornerstone for Campie in generating substantial revenue from Camelot DEX. As efforts intensify to usher more users into the Arbitrum Ecosystem and Campie, liquidity providers stand to gain a fraction of $ARB rewards, a testament to their dedication in fortifying the platform’s enduring viability.


How does converting GRAIL tokens benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem?






Camelot DEX liquidity providers can amplify their rewards on Campie without the need to lock GRAIL tokens themselves. This strategy attracts more conservative users to Arbitrum and provides a steady revenue flow, potentially increasing Camelot’s TVL.






Reward mGRAIL holders with an augmented share of revenue from Campie as a nod to their loyalty, expanding the opportunities for Camelot DEX participants.






Justification for the size of the grant
:


Magpie has been deployed on Arbitrum for almost 6 months now and has a TVL of 3.48 million, which represents more than 50% of the TVL within Wombat Exchange.


735×435 27.4 KB


Penpie has been deployed on Arbitrum for almost 4 months and has a TVL of 18 million.


737×560 36.2 KB


Currently, the Magpie XYZ Ecosystem holds over $26,000,000 in TVL within the Arbitrum network, distributed between Magpie, Penpie and Radpie. We anticipate this number to grow once and Campie is launched on the Arbitrum Mainnet.


As outlined in Arbitrum’s Short-Term Incentive Program, there are four grant categories accompanied by a set of recommended metrics. In line with these suggested qualifications, the Magpie XYZ Ecosystem would like to be considered within the ""Lighthouse Grant’'. At present, Magpie and Penpie have over 20 million in TVL. We are approaching our first six months of providing services to various protocols and users on Arbitrum. Our goal is not only to onboard new users to Arbitrum but also to enhance other top-tier platforms that provide their services and innovations to the community.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size
: 200,000 ARB


Grant Matching
: N/A. However, once we successfully get the grant, ChainX Bridge(our own bridge) will reduce 50%-70% charge for users who bridge assets to Arbitrum. Besides, we will upgrade our loyalty system to incentive users who bring new trading volume and deposit/borrow assets on Arbitrum(10%-20% scores based on the assets value, the scores can be exchange for our token in the near future).


Grant Breakdown
:

75% – Incentive users who deposit/borrow assets on Arbitrum based on their volume.

20% – Incentive users who bridge assets from/to Arbitrum based on their volume.

5% – Incentive users who experience DEX aggregation function in OmniBTC on Arbitrum.


Funding Address
:

arb1:0x002dbB9Ee09ae4d2b0E750387c83e799FF70d200


Funding Address Characteristics
:

It is a ⅔ multisig account on Arbitrum. The private keys are securely stored.


Contract Address
:

Marketing – “0x88F453111fE710b36b5b193971b8E7e7576be397”

OmniSwap –  “0xee2174cb3bc411A31Dd10363067E0B6Cf0aB0D37”

OmniLending –  “0x941ECfC6f02d037aF921fDC7431C78785638acDE”


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives
:

With the grant, OmniBTC will connect with more builders and users on Arbitrum, will help more users who interested in Arbitrum come into the Arbitrum ecosystem.

More specifically,




we will try to reach out 5MM liquidity deposited into Arbitrum, and 3 MM borrowed on Arbitrum.


Besides, we will reach out 120MM total trading volume on Arbitrum(50MM new trading volume on Arbitrum).


30,000 new active addresses & 50,000 new transactions will come into OmniBTC on Arbitrum.




Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
:




Weekly New Trading Volume on Arbitrum.


Weekly New Active Addresses on Arbitrum.


Weekly New Transactions on Arbitrum.


Total Deposit on Arbitrum in OmniLending.


Total Borrow on Arbitrum in OmniLending.




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
:




Reputation. Once Arbitrum has announced that OmniBTC is one of the grantees, OmniBTC will be more reliable for users who would like to use bridges.


More TXs and users. There is an exponential increase in OmniBTC. Half year ago, there were just 100 Daily Transactions. Now there are about 2,000 Daily TXs on Arbitrum via OmniBTC without any kinds of incentives or budget. We deeply believe that the grant can help us improve daily active transactions to 3,000 even more, and the total transactions happening on Arbitrum will be > 300 k.


Increase TVL in OmniLending on Arbitrum. OmniLending, the first available cross-chain lending function, is supporting Arbitrum so that users can easily deposit $ARB in our pools and borrow other assets on any chain. They can also deposit assets on other chains but borrow assets on Arbitrum. The biggest advantage for users is that they don’t need to bridge bridge bridge, but directly leveraging assets on Arbitrum. With the grant, we plan to attract 5 million assets deposited on Arbitrum. Now, our weekly trading volume has reached $7 MM, which means the monthly volume is＞$28 MM. As long as 18% of the volume is converted into our supply pool, we can realize the goal.


Integrate with DEXs on Arbitrum. OmniBTC will integrate with more DEXs on Arbitrum(now supporting UniV3, SushiSwap and Camelot), so that users can easily swap assets on other chains for any assets on Arbitrum. Then, we are willing to do co-promotions with DEXs on Arbitrum and attract more users to experience Arbitrum by using the grant.




Justification for the size of the grant
:

OmniBTC is an omnichain DeFi platform that connects all the on-chain liquidity using interoperability protocols such as L0, Wormhole, Celer Network. OmniBTC is also a decentralized cross-chain swap and lend/borrow platform built across multi-VM ecosystems, aiming to connect and unify all the on-chain liquidity for seamless and low-cost cross-chain transactions. Besides, most of our transactions happened on Arbitrum(> $70MM), with more than 140,000 active addresses. There is a great user foundation in OmniBTC on Arbitrum.


We have been granted by the Optimism Foundation too, with the grant, we successfully attract more than 25MM new trading volume come into Optimism, so that we are optimistic on realizing the goal og Arbitrum Grant. Besides, we also use 160,000 $SUI(about 100k in USD) to realize 4 MM total deposit and 3 MM total borrow on Sui.


The grant will only be used to attract more users to experience Arbitrum. We would like to use the grant to do the following promotion.






Bridge Assets from/to Arbitrum. OmniBTC will incentivize users who bridge assets from other chains to Arbitrum by using the grant.






Integrate with DEXs on Arbitrum. OmniBTC will integrate with more DEXs on Arbitrum(now supporting UniV3), so that users can easily swap assets on other chains for any assets on Arbitrum. Then, we are willing to do co-promotions with DEXs on Arbitrum and attract more users to experience Arbitrum by using the grant.






Increase TVL in OmniLending on Arbitrum. OmniLending, the first available cross-chain lending function, is supporting Arbitrum so that users can easily deposit $ARB in our pools and borrow other assets on any chain. They can also deposit assets on other chains but borrow assets on Arbitrum. The biggest advantage for users is that they don’t need to bridge bridge bridge, but directly leveraging assets on Arbitrum.






Invite Competition. Users who invite more new users to finish the OmniSwap from/to Arbitrum or deposit/borrow assets on Arbitrum can claim extra $ARB as reward.






Execution Strategy
:




Phase1(2 weeks): Incentives To Users Who Bridge Assets to Arbitrum. OmniBTC will incentivize users who bridge assets from other chains to Arbitrum. At present, each user will cost about 0.5-0.7 USD to bridge assets from other chains(except Ethereum) to Arbitrum. In return, we would like to refund them 30%-60% by using the grant.


Phase2(4 weeks): Incentives to users who realize OmniSwap from/to Arbitrum. For example, in the first week, the task may be that users who realize OmniSwap(from/to Arbitrum to another chain) via Uniswap V3 on OmniBTC can get 0.6-1 $ARB per day. The second week may be via Camelot.


Phase3(2 weeks): Incentive users who experience DEX aggregation on Arbitrum in OmniBTC.


Phase4(about 3-4 months): Incentive users who deposit/borrow assets on Arbitrum.

New Distribution:

● We divided the weekly allocation into 2 parts, for Lenders and for Borrowers.

● We set 3 thresholds for lenders, less than $3 MM, between $3 MM and $5 MM, from $5 MM to $10 MM.



● We set 3 thresholds for borrowers, less than $1 MM, between $1 MM and $3 MM, from $3 MM to $5 MM.



● It is our first time to use a large grant to attract funds, so we set up a limit to up to $10 MM total deposit on Optimism to ensure the security. If we achieve the $10 MM deposit at a fast speed, then we will gradually improve the up-limit under the stability. If we add more collateral into the protocol, we will change the shares of each token on Arbitrum.




Risk Management. 10% of protocol venenue will be used as a mini risk fund. Besides, 5% of OmniBTC token will be used as risk fund. Whats more, we will finish our second audit at the end of 2023.


We will continually incentive users who deposit/borrow assets on Arbitrum until we run out of the grant. If we reached 10MM deposit and 5MM borrow on Arbitrum at the first day, the incentives can last for more than 11 weeks(150,000/12,800).


We aim to attract new 50MM trading volume on Arbitrum wilth 50,000 $ARB. 50MM trading volume will cost users about 70-80k in USD, and the grant refunds users about 56%-64% cost.


Claim Reward: For phase 1-3, the reward can be claimed after per phase. For lending, users can directly claim reward at any time during the period.




Grant Timeline
:




2 weeks to incentive users who bridge assets to Arbitrum(12,000 ARB in 2 weeks).


4 weeks to incentive users who realize OmniSwap from/to Arbitrum(28,000 ARB in 4 weeks).


2 weeks to incentive users who experience DEX aggregation on Arbitrum(10,000 ARB in 2 weeks).


3-4 months to incentive users who deposit/borrow assets on Arbitrum(150,000 ARB in 11-16 weeks).

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size
: 1.3M ARB


1.2 million ARB direct for Coinbase Earn Campaign to reward $5-10 in ARB to 70,000-140,000 of their users who bridge USDC to Arbitrum and make a trade using Cryptex V2.


100k ARB directly to the Cryptex protocol to incentivize maker liquidity.


= 1.3M ARB


Grant Breakdown
: This grant seeks to bridge USDC from 70,000-140,000 Coinbase users to Arbitrum and have them interact with the Cryptex protocol via a Coinbase Earn campaign we will establish.


It is important to note 1.2M ARB of our grant request will be sent directly to Coinbase to reward Coinbase Earn users who complete Earn campaign tasks with ARB tokens.


To acquire these users from Coinbase, we seek to deploy this grant as follows during the allotted 3 month time period.




1.2m ARB deployed directly to a campaign that will incentivize Coinbase users and be visible to millions of Wallet and Exchange users on their platform until depleted.




These ARB will be rewarded to Coinbase users upon:


A. Bridging USDC to Arbitrum


B. Making a trade using TCAP, a perpetual market built by Cryptex that provides directional exposure to Total Crypto Market Capitalization.




Deploy 100k ARB in maker liquidity incentives to Cryptex’ TCAP/Total Crypto Market Capitalization Perpetual, running concurrent with the Coinbase campaign during the allotted 3 month time period.




It is important to note 100k ARB is what we are requesting on the protocol level.


100k ARB for direct Cryptex protocol maker incentives that we will deploy concurrently with the influx of users bridging USDC to Arbitrum for trading on Cryptex V2.


1.2 million ARB will be deployed directly to Coinbase from which we seek 70-140k users bridging USDC to Arbitrum.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives
: Our primary objectives are to create, deploy and scale cutting edge perpetual markets for Arbitrum users. Since Cryptex V2 deployment on June 6, 2023, we have:




Launched Cryptex V2 on Arbitrum, starting with Total Crypto Market Cap Perpetuals.


Announced partnership with Perennial Finance


Deployed 3 Perpetual Markets to Cryptex V2 (PEPE/USDC, ETH/USDC, ARB/USDC)


Continued work to grow the presence of CTX governance not only on CEX’s like Coinbase, Gemini and Huobi, but within the Arbitrum ecosystem via our recent partnership with CamelotDEX




If we are able to bridge 70,000-140,000 users to Arbitrum, we can try to create a win win scenario for not only Cryptex, but for the ecosystem as well. Once executed, this campaign will not only be viewable and accessible to millions of Coinbase Wallet users, but tens of millions of Exchange users as CTX is currently a listed asset on the Coinbase Exchange. Once these users complete bridging and making a trade on TCAP, there are no limitations to what other protocols/dapps they can interact with inside the Arbitrum ecosystem thereafter.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
: All Arbitrum community members and delegates can monitor unique system usage on Cryptex V2 via our Dune analytics dashboard and track actual results. All results are fully public at all times via our Dune dashboard. All results of these programs will be shared biweekly with the Forum.


https://dune.com/sashimiboi/cryptex-v2-dashboard


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
: Bridging 70,000-140,000 users to Arbitrum and having these users make a trade with a Total Crypto Market Cap Perpetual. TCAP is only available on Cryptex and Cryptex V2 is only available on Arbitrum.


Justification for the size of the grant
: 1.2 million ARB (1M USD) is the minimum sizing needed to do this campaign with Coinbase. 100k ARB (33.3k per month) for TCAP maker side liquidity incentives that run concurrent with Coinbase users placing a trade on the Cryptex dapp.


Execution Strategy
: [Describe the plan for executing including resources, products, use of funds, and risk management. This includes allocations for specific pools, eligible assets, products, etc.]




Cryptex DAO Core Contributors will create this campaign with the Coinbase team, executing both the 1.2 million ARB program and the specific actions required for users to earn the tokens as per this proposal. The specific actions to earn ARB tokens are as follows:








User bridges USDC to Arbitrum






User makes a trade using TCAP on Cryptex










Once these actions are executed by the user, Coinbase will reward each user who completes the above tasks between $5-$10 in ARB tokens.






Cryptex DAO Contributors will deploy 100k of ARB liquidity incentives in the TCAP Perpetual Market, running concurrent with the Coinbase Wallet incentive program.






Grant Timeline
: 90 Days


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?


Yes


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Provide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?
: Yes, the Cryptex V2 system we are seeking a grant to incentivize is currently native to Arbitrum.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?
: Cryptex V1 is deployed on Ethereum.


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?
: We deployed Cryptex V1 to Arbitrum on February 7th 2023 (JPEGz NFT Index and CTX Governance)

Cryptex V2 was launched on June 6th 2023.


Source:
 
https://twitter.com/CryptexFinance/status/1666119073753595904?s=20


Protocol Performance
: [Detail the past performance of the protocol and relevance, including any key metrics or achievements, dashboards, etc.]


Since deploying V2 on June 6th, the system has seen over 3.3mm of notional USDC volume from 1,884 unique takers and 67 unique makers. We understand delegates may view this activity as relatively small in comparison to others on the network, which is the key reason we are looking to scale system usage via the allocation of resources proposed in this campaign designed for bridging USDC to Arbitrum and interacting with Cryptex.


Since June 6th, we have launched or deployed a total of 4 perpetual markets to the Cryptex V2 system, with the goal of launching 3 new markets in Q4.


Currently, protocol liquidity for each perpetual market available via V2 is as follows:




TCAP/USDC= $74,291/3,000,000.




*Note: Launched 6/6/23. This market has been incentivized via received ARB airdrop proceeds that the Cryptex DAO voted to deploy back to Arbitrum users over a 3 month period in exchange for bootstrapping initial V2 system usage at launch.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives
:




Strengthen and expand Abracadabra infrastructure on Arbitrum


Solidify Abracadabra’s position as the preferred yield farming platform on Arbitrum


Develop Arbitrum Native products around


Explore and integrate more attractive collateral options within the Arbitrum ecosystem


Drive more user onboarding and engagement within the Arbitrum Ecosystem




The primary aim of this grant is to enhance the already thriving Abracadabra Money infrastructure on Arbitrum, solidifying its position as the preferred platform for yield farming on Arbitrum.

Being among the earliest products launched on Arbitrum (initially introduced on 16/09/21), Abracadabra has consistently depended on the Arbitrum ecosystem to explore compelling and lucrative collateral options. This grant will further support these efforts by facilitating the inclusion of additional collaterals in our MIM lending markets, and onboarding more users to the Arbitrum Ecosystem.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
:


IMG_4165
1075×674 112 KB


The combined TVL (Total Value Locked) of Abracadabra, including its cauldrons and other products, along with the total and percentage supply of MIM within the Arbitrum Ecosystem, serve as valuable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for monitoring the effectiveness and outcomes of the proposed grant.


Lastly, the launch of MIM Savings Rate (currently under development) natively on Arbitrum.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
: Currently, for every issued MIM, Abracadabra DAO needs to charge at least 6/7% interest. Collaterals delivering APYs below this, are therefore not interesting listings for the DAO.


1) Accepting new collaterals

As dedicated partners with various Arbitrum projects, the borrowing Incentives met with deeper MIM liquidity, will empower Abracadabra to include a variety of collateral assets that would otherwise remain ineligible for listing due to the interest rate requirements currently dictated by MIM cost of capital.


LP tokens, and Perpdex LPs as well as ARB are only some of the possible examples that could potentially be listed in the short term.


2) Innovation, Research and Development

Our DAO has consistently led the way in Arbitrum’s growth and eagerly anticipates making meaningful contributions by creating user-friendly products built on the most innovative technologies. MIM Savings rate native launch on Arbitrum, is a proof of this commitment to improvements and updates in the current set up.

Additionally, we are specifically working on a follow up Cauldron to the very popular magicGLP cauldron, leveraging upon the improvements of GMX v2 while creating an easy to use index token like GMX v1, composed of BTC, ETH and ARB GM tokens. This will allow for people to provide liquidity and set and forget it, as well as borrow against it using Abracadabra cauldrons. This index is currently under development, together with isolated GM tokens cauldrons.


Justification for the size of the grant
: Abracadabra has been a dedicated supporter of the Arbitrum ecosystem for over three years since its initial launch. In its early days in 2021, the Abracadabra ETH market attracted over $100 million in Total Value Locked (TVL), demonstrating remarkable growth especially considering bullish market conditions. Throughout this extended period, Abracadabra has established strong and enduring partnerships with key native protocols on Arbitrum, creating innovative products and contributing to the ecosystem’s ongoing development through consulting work and peer reviews. The DAO community has been steadily engaging with multiple Arbitrum Governance proposals, 
making their voice
 heard through on-chain and off-chain votes on multiple occasions.


The 1.5m ARB mentioned in this proposal will be used for multiple activities, all meant to further boost usage and activity on Arbitrum.


Deepening MIM-2Crv liquidity will result in higher trading volumes for DEXs, and slippage free environments for Arbitrum decentralized stablecoin users. Boosted APY will present valuable opportunities for cross chain yield farmers, looking for new chains in which they will be able to deploy their capital.


As a positive externality, these combined effects will result in higher on-chain fees being paid, thereby generating increased revenue for the Arbitrum DAO through sequencer fees.


Execution Strategy
: The grant will strategically allocated to three primary sources:


IMG_4167
1992×753 78.5 KB


Phase 1)

Phase 1 of our strategy is primarily centered around the expansion of substantial MIM liquidity, particularly against stable assets, directly on the Arbitrum network. To ensure the effectiveness of the subsequent two phases, it is crucial that we kickstart this growth with a robust incentive program.


Historically, substantial incentive programs have proven to be catalysts for fostering ‘sticky’ liquidity. This term refers to a situation where users and assets remain engaged and active within the ecosystem even as incentive rewards decrease. It essentially establishes a strong foundation for the following phases of our plan.


As we progress into Phase 2 and Phase 3, the successful establishment of ‘sticky’ liquidity in Phase 1 will enable us to gradually reduce the incentives. This strategic reduction is possible because the ecosystem, having gained momentum and engagement in Phase 1, will be more self-sustaining and less reliant on high incentives. This phased approach ensures a smoother transition towards a stable and thriving ecosystem on Arbitrum.


Phase 2)

After successfully enhancing liquidity levels, the next strategic step involves implementing direct borrow incentives to provide an additional boost to the development of Arbitrum native products, such as ARB-focused LP tokens and GM tokens. These incentives are designed to have a two-fold impact.


a) User Engagement and Adoption:
 Direct borrow incentives aim to increase the user count and overall activity on Arbitrum. By offering attractive borrowing incentives, we aim to attract and onboard the first wave of users and facilitate the adoption of new products. This not only strengthens the ecosystem but also encourages users to actively engage with Arbitrum native offerings.


b) Sustainable Ecosystem Growth:
 Concurrently, liquidity mining incentives will continue to operate, albeit at a decreasing rate. This strategy is intended to act as a sustaining force for the newly onboarded users and products. As the ecosystem matures, the decreasing rate of liquidity mining incentives helps maintain a healthy and balanced growth trajectory. It ensures that the ecosystem remains attractive for both new and existing participants, while gradually reducing reliance on high initial rewards.


In essence, this two-pronged approach leverages direct borrow incentives to kickstart initial adoption and user activity, while maintaining liquidity mining incentives to sustain long-term growth and stability within the Arbitrum ecosystem.


Phase 3)

The culmination of our strategy, Phase 3, promises an exciting opportunity to witness the MIM Savings Rate mechanism in full action. During this phase, the incentives for the MIM Savings Rate will be optimized for efficiency and effectiveness, distinguishing it from the earlier liquidity mining incentives. The equal distribution of ARB tokens during this period will enable us to conduct impartial and precise assessments of the various liquidity enhancement mechanisms in play.


Note: Phase 3 distribution for the MIM Savings Rate could happen ahead of time, depending on Research and Development timelines of the MIM Savings Rate. Distribution schedule will be adjusted ahead of schedule, and reported properly into the bi-weekly report.


As Phase 3 unfolds, we are poised to broaden our horizons by onboarding a more diverse array of exotic collateral assets developed around the innovations worked up over Phase 1 and Phase 2. Additionally, we anticipate the development of innovative products that will be intricately linked to emerging infrastructures. These advancements are expected to flourish, thanks in no small part to the overarching influence of the STIP product on the ecosystem as a whole.


Grant Timeline
: 4 Months (up until 31st January 2024)




Phase 1: Starting once the grant is received and lasting ⅓ of the time until 31st January 2024


Phase 2: Starts right after Phase 1 ends, and lasts a similar timeframe.


Phase 3: Same as above, and ends on 31st of January 2024, marking the end of the STIP grant for Abracadabra.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION




Objectives:




Stimulate Arbitrum’s LST (LSD) ecosystem


Onboard new on-chain users


Attract new institutional capital on Arbitrum


Jumpstart CIAN’s Dex on Arbitrum


Generate substantial fees for LST holders on external protocols




Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):


As CIAN’s vaults require users to only interact once with the protocol in order to execute their static “mid/long-term” position, the two predominant metrics relevant to performance are:




TVL


Active users




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


CIAN was launched, alongside its first vault (wstETH), on the Arbitrum network in June 2023. Since then, despite unfavorable market conditions, having no token nor added incentives, having faced multiple wstETH supply cap bottlenecks and limited wETH liquidity on AAVE V3, CIAN was able to capture and generate north of $9M TVL with its wstETH leveraged staking strategy vault.


1600×490 130 KB


This amount can be justified by the good reputation that CIAN has built over the years, specifically in the eyes of institutional partners and whales. Although our vaults aren’t generating extravagant APYs, the delta-neutral approach combined with our liquidation protection mechanism makes for a safe and sustainable investment choice.


This grant would allow CIAN to fully unveil the vault capacity due to its leveraged capital efficiency while indirectly stimulating Arbitrum’s LST ecosystem, most precisely by generating swap fees for wstETH/ETH LPs across various markets due to the multiple swaps necessitated in order to leverage & unwind deposited funds. Based on previous experiences, we are confident that a carefully-planned incentive program would yield considerable value for users while offering us an abundant source of quality marketing opportunities as this amount of ARB could easily be spread out over a 3-month period.


Justification for the size of the grant:


As per the actual state of ETH and wstETH on AAVE V3, given the incentive grant approval, CIAN’s team estimates that 380k ARB would enable the wstETH vault alone to increase its supply to a total of $30M wstETH in the first 2 months, eventually scaling and sustaining up to $35M by the end of January 2024.


|292.00000000000006x234.00000000000063
1044×838 59 KB
1011×846 58.5 KB


During this timeline, CIAN plans to dynamically adjust the incentives following the TVL growth curve in order to output a stable APY ranging from 20% to 12%. With a sustainable APY exceeding 12%, CIAN’s ARB wstETH vault would broadly outperform any other recursive looping strategies available on Ethereum Mainnet and L2s, hence making Arbitrum the most attractive network for our current/future users and institutional partners.


Execution Strategy:


All ARB tokens (380k) allocated to CIAN for incentivization would be distributed as is (ARB) to wstETH vault’s LP holders.


The ARB rewards would be dynamically adjusted over a period of 3 months to maintain a stable yield percentage, progressively decreasing as the vault’s TVL increases. The vault would originally offer a peak APY of 20-30% for a period of 2 weeks, during which we would conjointly launch a large marketing campaign with LIDO. Following the initial event, a multitude of smaller events would take place, promoting a sustainable APY averaging 15%.


To further guarantee a large-scale adoption, the current ecosystem would require minor changes to improve its scalability. For this, we already started to convey an action plan with LIDO that would help cement wstETH/ETH’s liquidity onchain.


As for the distribution mechanism, a Merkel tree contract would be deployed to record users’ reward data and receive their reward tokens (ARB). Users’ reward data will be regularly updated onchain upon deposit events, thus allowing them to claim their rewards at the desired frequency.


The ARB tokens would be stored and distributed from the following mutlisig address:


0x2970A6AECADFb0e8F396DaD8c48E566AdE010e5B


Grant Timeline:


As this is CIAN’s first public request to the Arbitrum DAO, proper milestone-based targets shall apply to set expectations.


Milestone 
#1:
 Total vault TVL: $15M by the end of October, 2023

Milestone 
#2:
 Total vault TVL: $22M by the end of November, 2023

Milestone 
#3:
 Total vault TVL: $29M by the end of December, 2024

Milestone 
#4:
 Total vault TVL: $35M by the end of January, 2024


The ARB grant will start being distributed within 7 days of the receipt of the first payment. This grant will be streamed bi-weekly to the above-mentioned Multisig throughout the duration of the STIP. The grant will expire when either all 380,000 ARB have been distributed to users, or the 01/31/24 deadline is hit, upon which the remainder shall be returned to the Arbitrum DAO Treasury.


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?:


Yes. The funding may be halted at any time by the DAO based on milestone progress and/or general satisfaction.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size:
  750,000 $ARB


Grant Matching:
  1,350,000 $archi


Grant Breakdown:
  Archi Finance is a leveraged yield farming protocol. Due to market factors, the interest for both Degen farmers and passive liquidity providers has been continuously decreasing.


To ensure the platform’s healthy and stable growth, we aim to incentivize passive liquidity providers with ARB rewards on a monthly basis. Additionally, in order to encourage Degen users to increase their positions and earn more interest, we will be transitioning Archi tokens from previously rewarding passive liquidity providers to Degen farmers. All data can be queried and assessed through Dune.




90% (675,000 ARB) will be equally shared between 6 passive liquidity pools


10% (75,000 ARB) will be given to archi token stakers

How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:

First and foremost, it is necessary to clarify that Archi Finance, as a native Arb protocol, is essentially designed to help users increase their earnings while mitigating risks. In other words, our primary business is to discover sustainable, high-yield strategies from other protocols and provide them to users. Archi’s growth is contingent on the development of other protocols.


Taking our current primary business, the GLP strategy, as an example, users can utilize our platform to provide liquidity and earn staking rewards for degenerate users. In return, degenerate users can employ delta hedged strategies for four different assets. As of now, there have been no liquidations, demonstrating that this strategy can generate additional income for users while ensuring security.


Recently, the cryptocurrency market has been influenced by various factors, resulting in a sustained period of low performance. This has led to a decrease in GLP APR, despite of our high usage, the real yield for passive liquidity providers have dropped to around 2%, and degenerate farmers’ earnings have similarly decreased to 14%.


In this context, receiving this grant is crucial for us. The specific details are as follows:


We intend to allocate this grant in a reasonable proportion and manner to enhance the earnings of our current passive liquidity providers, attracting more investors to pay attention to and participate in Archi Finance.


Currently, the platform’s native token, $Archi, is not offered to degenerate users. Given the decreased willingness of degen famers to open positions in the current market conditions, and in line with the first point regarding grant utilization, we will direct Archi tokens towards degens. This will stimulate platform growth and increase degenerate user earnings.


Archi Finance is constantly seeking secure, efficient, and stable protocols and formulating high APR strategies for users through the collective wisdom of our team and community. To ensure the stability of these strategies and the security of our contracts, we require substantial development time, audit costs, and communication and coordination efforts. We have never doubted the project’s future scalability, but due to the cryptocurrency market’s lackluster performance, there has been a gap before the introduction of new strategies. Acquiring and effectively utilizing this grant will help us navigate this challenging period.


As outlined above, obtaining this grant will not only allow us to better reward our investors who have consistently supported us but will also help us effectively weather the bear market. Moreover, it represents significant support for the future development of our platform, the expansion of our user base, and our continued contribution to the Arb ecosystem.


Justification for the size of the grant:


*All the calculations are based on current token price and pool size


Arb tokens will be distributed evenly according to above percentage over course of  4 month.


WechatIMG21942
812×634 117 KB


With the current pool size, the grant from arb is expected to bring an additional yield of around 30% to our passive liquidity providers. We anticipate that the APR will stabilize at around 15%, resulting in a doubling of passive liquidity. When combined with the additional archi tokens we are providing to degen farmers, we aim to achieve our goal of 20 million during this period.


Execution Strategy:


Every month, Archi Finance will receive 186.5k ARB and distribute all of it to investors. 90% will be evenly distributed among six passive pools, and 10% will be rewarded to Archi stakers. The received ARB rewards will be proportional to the amount staked. All data will come from on-chain data, and users can verify the data by comparing it to DeFiLlama and Dune Dashboard.


As for the distribution mechanism, we have already deployed a Merkel tree contract that would record users’ reward data and receive their reward tokens (ARB). Users’ reward data will be regularly updated onchain upon deposit events, thus allowing them to claim their rewards monthly.


Grant Timeline:




After approval: 186.5k $arb


Before 1st December :186.5k $arb


Before 1st January :186.5k $arb


Before 1st February: 186.5k $arb

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size
: 500,000 ARB


Grant Matching
: Yes. Notional will incentivize pools with $NOTE alongside $ARB over the course of the grant. Notional will contribute 585,000 $NOTE in liquidity incentives between October 25th 2023 and January 31st 2024.


Grant Breakdown
: The purpose of this grant would be to incentivize liquidity providers on Notional and help kickstart the growth of the protocol on Arbitrum. This grant would both incentivize new users to try Notional as well as encourage Notional’s userbase on Ethereum to bridge their funds to Arbitrum.


These incentives will help Notional deliver high, single-sided yield to the most popular assets in DeFi which will support liquid, fixed-rate lending and borrowing markets to Arbitrum users and attract capital from other chains.


Funding Address
: 0xbf778Fc19d0B55575711B6339A3680d07352B221


Funding Address Characteristics
: The funding address is a 2 / 3 Safe controlled by the Notional Core Team.


Contract Address
: The airdrop contract we would use to distribute the ARB incentives is not currently deployed but we would plan to use this Merkle distributor: 
https://github.com/Uniswap/merkle-distributor/blob/master/contracts/MerkleDistributor.sol
.


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives
: The primary objective of this grant is to bootstrap initial liquidity for Notional V3 on Arbitrum. Specifically, we would aim to generate fixed rate liquidity for stablecoins, ETH, wBTC, and LSDs.


The liquidity that Notional would attract via this grant would produce the following benefits for Arbitrum users and the Abritrum ecosystem:






Deep and liquid markets for fixed rate lending and borrowing of the most popular crypto assets. This does not exist today and would be a net new product offering for the Arbitrum ecosystem.






Deep and liquid leveraged yield opportunities that are built on fixed rate leverage and utilize other Arbitrum ecosystem projects like Balancer and Curve to source yield. This would also be a net new product offering for advanced DeFi users on Arbitrum. Additionally, the liquidity deployed into these leveraged vault products would directly increase liquidity for the Arbitrum ecosystem projects that the vaults are integrated with. (Background on leveraged vaults: 
Introducing Leveraged Vaults
)






The grant would produce high, single-sided yield opportunities for both active and passive DeFi users which would help attract more capital to the Arbitrum ecosystem from other chains.






Key Performance Indicators
: We will use three KPIs to track the success of this grant:




Notional TVL.


Total open debt.


Leveraged vault TVL.




TVL growth will show whether this grant has been successful in attracting capital to Notional. Total open debt will show whether the capital that has been attracted has been utilized. Leveraged vault TVL will show how much of the capital that has been attracted has been deployed onto other Arbitrum protocols to increase their liquidity.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
: The liquidity that this grant would help Notional attract would have immediate benefits to Notional users as well as longer-term benefits to the Arbitrum ecosystem at large. The immediate impact for Arbitrum users would be deep and liquid fixed rate lending and borrowing markets for the most popular crypto assets. This gives Arbitrum users new and attractive options to manage their interest rate risk, both as lenders and borrowers.


Longer-term, liquid markets on Notional contribute to the Arbitrum ecosystem via Notional’s leveraged vault integrations. Leveraged vaults allow users to borrow from Notional and deploy the borrowed capital into DeFi-native yield strategies that utilize one or more external protocols.


Leveraged vaults give active DeFi users highly leveraged exposure to the yield of the strategy and directly increase the availability of capital and liquidity for external protocols that are used in the strategy. Additionally, usage of leveraged vaults increases interest rates on Notional via borrowing and makes high, single-sided APYs available to Notional lenders at fixed or variable rates.


Notional currently supports leveraged vault strategies built on Balancer/Aura and Curve/Convex. This means that some of that liquidity that flows to Notional via this grant will be redeployed to Balancer and Curve via Notional’s leveraged vaults and will transform the yields on those DEXes into single-sided lending yields for passive DeFi users on Notional.


Notional is currently working on integrating more protocols on Arbitrum via leveraged vaults and should support more strategies by the end of the year. This means that the liquidity attracted to Notional from this grant would help to support a growing number of Arbitrum projects and strengthen the overall Arbitrum ecosystem going forward.


Justification for the size of the grant
: Notional has a proven track record of shipping innovative products and generating traction over a long period of time. Notional has established itself as the leader in fixed rate lending and borrowing on Ethereum and has committed to investing in Arbitrum as our exclusive L2.


We believe that Notional’s track record, our commitment to Arbitrum, and the value that this grant can create for the Arbitrum ecosystem and user base justify the request.


Execution Strategy
: ARB incentives will be distributed to liquidity providers by airdrop every two weeks starting November 8th and ending January 31st. Notional will publish a Dune dashboard that tracks ARB incentives earned by address in real-time over each two week period.


At the end of each period the output of this dune dashboard will be used to seed an airdrop contract. The Notional core team will deploy the airdrop contract and distribute the total ARB for that period from the funding contract (0xbf778Fc19d0B55575711B6339A3680d07352B221) within 24 hours of the end of the 2-week period.


Here is the indicative split of ARB incentives to liquidity providers by currency over the life of the grant and for each of the seven 2-week periods.


USDC: 120,000 ARB total. 17,143 ARB per two-week period.

DAI: 50,000 ARB. 7,143 ARB per two-week period.

USDT: 50,000 ARB. 7,143 ARB per two-week period.

FRAX: 50,000 ARB. 7,143 ARB per two-week period.

ETH: 120,000 ARB total. 17,143 ARB per two-week period.

wstETH: 50,000 ARB. 7,143 ARB per two-week period.

rETH: 50,000 ARB. 7,143 ARB per two-week period.

wBTC: 10,000 ARB. 1,429 ARB per two-week period.


Grant Timeline
: ARB will be distributed linearly and continuously from October 25th 2023 when Notional V3 launches out of Beta to January 31st 2024.


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?
: Yes.


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Is the protocol native to Arbitrum?
: Notional initially deployed on Ethereum in 2021. Notional V1 launched in January 2021 and Notional V2 launched in November 2021. Notional V3 has been deployed on Arbitrum for internal testing since May 2nd 2023 and will go live in closed Beta on September 25th 2023. Notional V3 will then go fully live on Arbitrum on October 25th 2023.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?
: Ethereum.


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?
: May 2nd 2023


Protocol Performance
: Notional V2 has been live on Ethereum Mainnet since November 2021. Here are major points that Notional V2 has accomplished on Ethereum Mainnet since launch:




Executed $770M in total loan volume.


Currently holds $27M in TVL.


Established leading position in the fixed rate lending and borrowing category.


Launched the first leveraged yield strategy product using fixed rate leverage.


Integrated with leading protocols like Balancer, Curve, Yearn, Spool, Phuture, and Index Coop.




Notional V3 has been deployed on Arbitrum in an internal testing capacity since May 2023. The protocol on Arbitrum currently holds $135K and will go live in closed Beta on September 25th 2023.


Protocol Roadmap
: Notional’s roadmap from here is focused on developing new leveraged vault integrations with protocols native to Arbitrum and opening up new leveraged vault strategies. Here is what we expect to accomplish in the coming months:




Support for more leveraged yield strategies on Balancer and Aura. Specifically, these pools:



wstETH/WETH


4Pool


wstETH/rETH/cbETH


rETH/WETH






Leveraged yield strategies that allow users to arbitrage fixed interest rates between like-assets on Notional like wstETH/ETH, FRAX/USDC, etc.


Onboard Arbitrum-native collateral assets including tokens like ARB and GMX.


Develop a leveraged vault integration with GMX.


Develop a cross-chain vault that will allow users to arbitrage interest rates on Notional between Ethereum Mainnet and Arbitrum. This will result in moving capital from Ethereum Mainnet to Arbitrum where the yields are higher.




We believe that this roadmap is set to deliver a lot of value to advanced DeFi users, passive DeFi users, and the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole.

Project Name: Stella


Project Description:

Stella is a leveraged yield farming protocol on Arbitrum with 0% cost to borrow. Stella enables leveraged strategies on top of capital efficient yield sources like Uniswap DEXs, TraderJoe liquidity book, and the Pendle PT pools, with integrations with Camelot V3 and Penpie coming soon.


The innovation about Stella is that it offers 0% cost to borrow, and leveragoors only pay a portion of their profitable positions upon closing. If the position is not profitable, the leveragoors do not have to pay any borrowing cost. The model is beneficial for lenders as well since their incentives are aligned with the leveragoor, and their upside is uncapped in market scenarios where leveragoors have more profitable positions.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION

[Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.]


Requested Grant Size: 186k ARB


Grant Matching: NA


Grant Breakdown: [Please provide a high-level overview of the budget breakdown and planned use of funds]


Stella has two parts to it: Stella Strategies (the leveraged strategies part) and Stella Lend (the lending pools on Stella). The 186k ARB of incentives will be distributed between the two parts as follows:






~66K ARB as incentives deployed on Stella Strategies




Stella will provide additional 20% yields for leveragoors on top of their profitable positions.


The additional incentive will only be provided on profitable positions, not on unprofitable positions. This will help protect from sybil attacks and incentivize good behavior.


Stella currently runs a similar ‘leveragoor incentive’ program by providing 20% additional yields on profitable leveragoor positions.


Extrapolating numbers from Stella’s previous ‘leveragoor incentive’ program to the Arbitrum STIP program, we expect to achieve a target TVL of 3M by utilizing ~66k ARB tokens in incentives.


The detailed derivation and breakdown of numbers is shared in the ‘Section 3’ of the proposal under ‘Justification of grant size’.








~120K ARB to use as incentives deployed on Stella Lending pools




Stella currently offers 3-10% APY in real yield on popular lending pairs.


Stella is launching the LST-based PT strategies on top Pendle (live on 29th Sept), and Penpie (live on Oct 3rd). Due to this, we expect a surge in ETH pool utilization. Additionally, Stella will add support to many strategies using ETH and USDC as quote assets, thus increasing the utilization of the ETH and USDC pools.


Stella needs an additional ~2-5% in lending APY on these assets to be more competitive and help bootstrap initial liquidity. Once the liquidity is there on the lending side, leveragoors will be able to open more positions, which will translate into higher (and sustainable) organic APY for lenders. This will offset the need for more lending incentives in the future.


Based on historical data, a TVL of $5M is needed on the lending side to support $3M of leveragoor TVL.


To achieve the additional 5% APY, we would need to utilize ~120k ARB in incentives over the period of 14 weeks.


The detailed derivation and breakdown of numbers is shared in the ‘Section 3’ of the proposal under ‘justification of grant size’








Any remaining funds by 31st Jan 2024 will be returned back to the Arbitrum DAO.


Funding Address: 0x2e39FbB069aCcD1959D003297250129879eb20A1

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


[Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.]


Objectives: [Clearly state the primary objectives of the grant and what you intend to achieve]


The primary objectives are :






Attract more DeFi users to Arbitrum by offering leverage on real yields :

Stella stands out as a leveraged yield protocol in the DeFi space with the unique ‘0% cost to borrow’ offering. This unique value proposition allows ~70% of the leveragoor positions on Stella to be profitable with +600% APY on average - much higher than counterparts. The levered real yields through Stella would help attract DeFi native users and sticky liquidity to Arbitrum.






Bring access to leveraged yields on various assets with unique integrations :

Stella intends to bring access to the highest yields in the ecosystem on a variety of assets by offering leverage on top of unique integrations. Stella is the only place on Arbitrum to leverage LP into Uniswap V3, TraderJoe Liquidity book or Pendle AMM. Through these multiple integrations, Stella offers yields on assets like ETH, ARB, Stables, LSDs and protocol tokens like RDNT, HMX, PENDLE, GMX etc.






Strengthen liquidity pools for innovative protocols :

Stella has listed leveraged LPing strategies for several innovative protocol token pairs like HMX/ETH, RDNT/ETH, PENDLE/ETH, GMX/ETH etc. These strategies in turn contribute to up to 10% of the underlying DEX pool TVL, helping increase the depth of the pool. Also, since leveragoors on Stella take an average leverage of 3X, leveragoors will bring in 3X the liquidity in these pools using Stella, compared to if they had directly LPed into the DEX pool. Stella is also building on top of Camelot V3 as well to support more Arbitrum native protocol token pools, and strengthen liquidity for those pools.






We believe that the above points will help enable the ultimate goal of making Arbitrum as the main L2 to access leveraged LP strategies and increase the liquidity in DEXs.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): [Specify the KPIs that will be used to measure success in achieving the grant objectives]


The following are the KPIs and metrics that should be achieved by the end of Jan 2024 :




Protocol TVL - Reach $6M in TVL (235% increase from now)


Total Positions - 4,000 leveraged positions on Stella (135% increase from now)


New Strategy Listing - List 1 new leveraged strategy per month on the integration partner protocols towards the end of Jan 2024


% of Strategy TVL of underlying DEX pools - Contribute 10% of the total TVL on the underlying DEX pools


Protocol users - 300 monthly active users (MAU) on Stella


Cumulative leveragoor real yield - $120,000 cumulative real yield earned by leveragoors on Stella (140% increase from now)

How will receiving a grant to enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?: [Provide details]


There are 4 ways we see this benefiting the Arbitrum ecosystem :






Go-to yield source on Arbitrum :

Stella is providing leveraged LPing on blue chip protocols like Pendle, Uniswap V3, and TraderJoe V2. Stella will enable up to 10X leverage on LSD token-based Pendle PT pools, enabling highest yields on Arbitrum ecosystem for DeFi users. Stella’s unique ‘0% cost to borrow’ model enables ~70% leveragoors to be profitable, which is much higher than counterparts. This will in turn benefit existing users on Arbitrum, and attract DeFi degens onto Arbitrum.






Bootstrapping liquidity for innovate Arbitrum Native protocol tokens :

One of Stella’s focuses is to increase the liquidity for the Arbitrum native token pools. This is especially important to facilitate more activity to the Arbitrum native protocols. Stella currently supports up to 10% of the TVL of the underlying DEX pool for Arbitrum protocol pools like Radiant (RDNT/ETH), Pendle (PENDLE/ETH) and HMX (HMX/ETH). Stella also plans to integrate with Camelot V3 to support leveraged LPing on top of the pools of Arbitrum native protocol tokens.






Better liquidity in the DEX pools, lower price impact :

Incentives on Stella Strategy will help attract more liquidity in the Stella strategies, which in turn will increase the liquidity in the underlying DEX pools. Since leveragoors on average take a 3X leverage on Stella, they bring 3X the volumes in the underlying DEX pool, compared to if they had directly LPed into the DEX pool. The increased volume in the DEX pools enable low price impact swaps for the community. With the ARB incentives and high leverage strategies, Stella will be able to provide the highest yields for these pools.






Lending opportunities for Arbiturm Native tokens :

Stella works closely with Arbitrum partner protocols to list their tokens on the lending side, and help bootstrap liquidity. This allows the token holders to earn passive yields by lending their tokens, increases ecosystem utility of the tokens, and in turn reduces sell pressure. Some popular Arbitrum protocols with lending pools include Pendle (4.1% organic APY), Radiant (5.8% organic APY), HMX (11% organic APY), JOE (8% organic APY), GMX (4.7% organic APY) etc.






Justification for the size of the grant: [Enter explanation]


We will break down the justification into two parts : The justification on grant size and the justification on Stella being the right candidate for this grant.




Justification of grant size :




The requested liquidity incentive is needed in this size since Stella would need to incentivize both the strategy and the lending side to get the flywheel started. Choosing to incentivize just one side would inhibit the scaling process.


To share the derivation of the exact numbers of the Stella Strategy and Stella Lend :






Stella Strategy :

Stella currently runs a similar ‘leveragoor incentive’ program by providing 20% additional yields on profitable leveragoor positions. Given the incentive program will run for 14 weeks, we expect incentives worth ~$52.8k to achieve a target TVL of 3M assuming the ‘incentive supplied to TVL achieved’ ratio will remain the same. At $0.8 per ARB token, this translates to ~66k ARB.






Stella Lend :

Stella needs to reach a target TVL of $5M on the lending side to support $3M in leveragoor TVL. A 5% APY on a TVL of $5M over a duration of 14 weeks translates to roughly $96.4k in incentives. At $0.8 per ARB, this translates to ~120k ARB.








Justification on Stella being the right candidate for this grant :






Stella is the most capital efficient yield source on Arbtrum offering the highest leverage. Stella offers unique integrations to CLAMMs and Pendle AMM and Arbitrum Native token pairs.


Stella is an Arbitrum native yield protocol. We have invested in providing the most secure and sustainable source of yields for the Arbitrum community, including getting multiple audits from the likes of Peckshield, Trust etc.




Execution Strategy: [Describe the plan for executing including resources, products, use of funds, and risk management. This includes allocations for specific pools, eligible assets, products, etc.]


The execution strategy can be divided into the following :






KPI Tracker : Set up the data dashboard for the community to continuously keep track of the efficacy of the incentives deployed. Efforts to build out this tracker will be kickstarted as soon as the grant is approved, and will be live by mid November (in time for the first bi-weekly update).






Risk Management : Stella only lists strategies that cross our robust risk management framework. The framework includes listing blue chip project tokens, relying on robust price feeds only (like Chainlink), listing pools with high enough TVL etc. On the Stella Lend side, we ensure liquidity and safety of pools by putting in borrow caps by evaluating on a pool by pool basis.






Community updates : The Stella team will provide bi-weekly updates of the incentive program in the forum thread, and would be responsible for answering any questions from the community.






Disbursement of funds : This section includes details on allocation of funds, pools, and mechanism of distribution.










Allocations of funds :

66k ARB will be directed towards incentivizing the Stella strategies, while 120k ARB will be directed towards incentivizing lending pools on Stella Lend. A detailed breakdown of these numbers has been shared in Section 2 above.






Disbursement mechanism :

The ARB incentives given to the leveragoors through Stella strategies will not be directly distributed, but rather will be auto-deposited in the ARB lending pool on Stella and would be with linear vesting over 30 days. This would prevent immediate dumping of ARB tokens, and will also allow leveragoors to earn additional “lending yields” for the next 30 days. On the lending side as well, this would help bootstrap liquidity in the ARB lending pool.






Allocation for pools :

On the Stella strategies side, all the profitable leveragoors get the additional 20% incentives regardless of the strategy/pool. On the lending side, the incentives will be distributed on a per dollar basis regardless of the pool. Since we expect higher TVL in the ETH and USDC pool, we expect a higher % of the incentives going towards those assets.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size
: 806k ARB


Grant Matching
: Arrakis currently does not have a token but will in the future. Potentially, we could see grant matching from the LST protocols that use the services of Arrakis.


Grant Breakdown:
 100% of the tokens will be used for liquidity mining.


Funding Address:
 0x77BADa8FC2A478f1bc1E1E4980916666187D0dF7


Funding Address Characteristics:
 This is a 4/7 gnosis safe on Arbitrum


Contract Address:
 This will be provided at a later stage once vaults are deployed.


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives
: This grant will be used to incentivize liquidity on the Arrakis LST Vaults to make Arbitrum the most liquid chain for LST assets. The objective here is to have the lowest price impact for buying and selling LSTs (stETH, rETH, cbETH, frxETH).


7 LST Vaults will be deployed:

wstETH/WETH

wstETH/USDC

rETH/WETH

rETH/USDC

cbETH/WETH

cbETH/USDC

frxETH/FRAX


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
: The KPI here are: Volume facilitated, and overall volume growth verse other chains of these LST assets.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


Arrakis LST Vaults provide an algorithmic market-making strategy. The algorithm is optimized for the market depth of LSTs and risk management for LPs. The strategy deployed on Uniswap V3 uses limit orders, asymmetric liquidity, and algorithmic rebalancing in order to minimize price impact for larger trades and make liquid staking tokens actually liquid. This means that Arbitrum can reduce their expenditure on liquidity mining rewards because less capital is required to establish a liquid market, while LPs can benefit from a strategy that efficiently manages their inventory and mitigates the risk of impermanent loss.


With this grant, Arbitrum should be able to become the number one place for LSTs, as can be seen with the current Lido LST vaults on mainnet and optimism theyre significant volume drivers. If LSTs are highly liquid, collateral backed stablecoins and LST lending markets on Arbitrum will flourish.


Justification for the size of the grant
: The requested grant size will lead to each pool having 38.38k ARB as liquidity mining incentives per month for 3 months. This will allow each LST vault to receive a significant TVL (~ >$1m) and result in a highly liquid market due to a low price impact.


Execution Strategy
:

The execution will run as follows:

If the grant gets approved, the ARB tokens would be sent to the funding address.

Then these 7 LST Vaults with gauges would be deployed:


wstETH/WETH - Rewards per month:38.38k ARB

wstETH/USDC - Rewards per month:38.38k ARB

rETH/WETH - Rewards per month:38.38k ARB

rETH/USDC - Rewards per month:38.38k ARB

cbETH/WETH - Rewards per month:38.38k ARB

cbETH/USDC - Rewards per month:38.38k ARB

frxETH/FRAX - Rewards per month:38.38k ARB


The process of deployment would likely take 2-4 days.

Once the pools and gauges are deployed, the gauge would be filled with on a weekly basis. Each week rewards are provided by Arbitrum gauges will be topped up.


Grant Timeline
: The funds from the grant would be used over a 3 month period from the time of them being sent.


If this proposal is greater than 1M ARB, please provide details on any funding tranches or milestones your application aims to abide by:


Funding Tranches:N/A


Milestone Descriptions: N/A


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Provide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?
: No, Arrakis Finance is deployed on top of UniV3 and thus is available wherever UniV3 exists.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?
: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, Optimism, Base


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?
: V1 was deployed on Arbitrum in 2021, V2 was deployed in January 2023.


Protocol Performance
:

On Arbitrum:




Current protocols utilizing Arrakis PALM: Thales, Y2K, Premia, Unstoppable


TVL: $1m




We believe it is important to mention TVL in other places as we would like to help Arbitrum excel and think we can do this by advertising to our existing users on other chains to move to Arbitrum. This existing userbase could have a significant impact on Arbitrum.




Arrakis Finance is currently the largest Liquidity Manager and at its peaking has a TVL over $1.7b (currently around $200m)


More than 25% of the Uniswap V3 total TVL


80+ projects have had their liquidity managed by Arrakis vaults, projects include: Lido Finance, Frax Finance, MakerDAO, Stargate Finance, UMA and many more.




Protocol Roadmap
:

The relevant products involved in this protocol are Arrakis V2 and the Arrakis LST Vaults.


Arrakis V2
: Arrakis V2 has been live since January 2023 and can be thought of as an abstraction layer on top of concentrated liquidity AMMs like Uniswap V3. It enables central limit order book (CLOB) like interactions. This allows market makers to offer and execute advanced strategies that up to this point have only been feasible on centralized exchanges (CEXs). The protocol itself is open for everyone to use and has no protocol fees. Anyone can become a vault manager that deploys vaults, executes market making strategies, and in return receives fees from the LPs who deposited into their vaults.


Liquidity providers, which can be DAOs, protocols, institutions or individuals, can either use private vaults that are exclusive to them, or opt into existing public ones that everyone can join. A Vault has a privileged manager role that can execute arbitrary market making strategies which can optimize for deep liquidity, trading fee APRs or mimicing traditional AMM invariants, such as constant product, stableswap, or Curve V2.


Arrakis LST Vaults
: Arrakis LST Vaults are a new product built on top of the V2 infrastructure and was launched in September with the first user being Lido Finance.


Arrakis LST Vaults provide an algorithmic market-making strategy that LST protocols can utilize and incentivize through liquidity mining rewards. The algorithm is optimized for the market depth of LSTs and risk management for LPs. The strategy deployed on Uniswap V3 uses limit orders, asymmetric liquidity, and algorithmic rebalancing in order to minimize price impact for larger trades and make liquid staking tokens actually liquid. This means that LST protocols can reduce their expenditure on liquidity mining rewards because less capital is required to establish a liquid market, while LPs can benefit from a strategy that efficiently manages their inventory and mitigates the risk of impermanent loss.


Upcoming other products are vaults specific for other usecases such as stablecoins. Furthermore, we are also working on Uniswap V4 hooks.


Audit History
: 3 Audits have been done by Watchpug, Statemind, and Sherlock and can be found here:

V2 Core: 
https://github.com/ArrakisFinance/v2-core/tree/main/audit

V2 Periphery: 
https://github.com/ArrakisFinance/v2-periphery/tree/main/audit




SECTION 5: DATA AND REPORTING


Provide details on how your team is equipped to provide data and reporting on grant distribution.


Is your team prepared to create Dune Spells and/or Dashboards for your incentive program?
: Yes, all the vaults will have dashboards similar to this: 
https://dashboard.arrakis.finance/


Does your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread?
 Yes, we certainly can provide bi weekly updates in the form of dashboard snapshots and explanations.


Does your team acknowledge that failure to comply with any of the above requests can result in the halting of the program’s funding stream?
: Yes.


We look forward to hearing your feedback and answering any questions!"

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives:


E3 has a laser focus on top-performing markets exclusively. It’s goal is to maximize the Asset Exchange in select key pairs, mainly ETH/USD & Native-Token/USD variants.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):






Weekly Trade Volumes

A good indicator of healthy activity. More is better generally, as each $1 of volume during volatile periods is more desired than the same volume during stable trends.






Weekly Trade Fees

Absolute indicator of results. More fees directly represents a more successful E3.






How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?


E3 is the  smallest project in this Grants Round 1. Yet, it is extremely more Capital Efficient than other DEXes on Arbitrum more often than not. Our other partners sometimes omit out our data due to our small size. Currently, we do not have a token, and most of the TVL is self-funded by Guru Network’s Treasury via direct seeds & regular giveaways. This Grant would let us provision more liquidity which we believe will propel our numbers to a common denominator with our peers. And then, our Numerator will speak for itself.


With the novel blend of Composability & Modularity with our “Bucket” model, we envision a future where DAOs and power users who are fanatics of Extreme Capital Efficiency will build on top of E3. That aside, Guru Network itself has multiple novel innovations such as the Fertilizer ALM.


Justification for the size of the grant:


We did roughly $70,000 to $150,000 volume each day on average over the last 30 days, without any added incentive. With 1337 ARB, worth ~$1000, we can procure a Liquidity Depth that can produce a Volume [upwards] of $1 Million per day, assuming a modest 0.1% Yield per day, i.e. a 36.5% “APR”, to our Liquidity Providers.


As always, we put up the conservative estimates first. But if we extrapolate our current metrics based on rates across the industry, we can easily see days with over $2 Million, even $10 Million in ETH/USD volumes per day on E3, with this 1337 ARB/day. But for the record, we would like to set the bar at $1 Million per day.


As the smallest project on this Round, our Ask is also the smallest in this Round, and is in direct proportion to our Size and aspirations, which we believe will Scale inline with Arbitrum’s Worldwide adoption. We are here for the long haul, and see this Round as an opportunity to onboard early birds to our EⅢ nest, flying together in this incessant Odyssey.


Execution Strategy:


Guru Network has been a staunch supporter of Open-source wares and prides itself in contributing to and utilizing the same for its day-to-day needs. We will employ Dune, DefiLlama and pusblish Merkles on Github for 100% transparency.


The incentivized pools are subject to market conditions but will primarily focus on the broad market assets that are ETH & USD vehicles (Stablecoins).


Grant Timeline:


100 days, nearing completion on the 31st of coming January 2024.


Accept that the funding of our grant be streamed linearly for the duration of our grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt our stream:


Yes.


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?


EⅢ has no external dependencies from any other Chain. E3 does not have a token, nor is it cross-chain. Arbitrum has been, and currently is E3’s main chain.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?


EⅢ runs on Fantom & Base besides Arbitrum. All deployments are independent of each other and do not influence the operations of other chains or versions.


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?


June 2023 (v17)


Protocol Performance:




Ranked 
#1
 AMM DEX by Capital Efficiency on DefiLlama over 25 times.


Top 15 DEX on Arbitrum by Fees and Top 20 by Volume.


One of the highest Fees/TVL ratio in DeFi.




Protocol Roadmap:




Fertilizer - Automated Liquidity Management


F*token staking & farming


Lending against F*tokens




Audit History:


While E3 is has a slightly modified core and usage, it still inherits its structure and codebase from it’s uncle Joe. All audits to TraderJoe v2.1 apply to E3 v17.


(v17 is the current and stable version of E3, and has been in use for over 6 months)


SECTION 5: Data and Reporting


In 2021, Guru Network ventured into the arena of Data Analytics to fulfil the Point 1 of our manifesto — 1.) Help. — to enable our community on Fantom to visualize fantom’s blockchain activity & substitute its explorer for a week during its downtime. Ever since, Guru Network has served well over 50 clients with bespoke data analytics and visualization apps, ranging from DeFi to e-Commerce, on-chain activity heatmaps & Real-time target tracking to Artistic Data Viz atop fNFTs.


Is your team prepared to create Dune Dashboards for your incentive program?


Yes. Guru Network team is one of the oldest “wizards” on Dune.


Team agrees to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread:


Yes, we agree to provide updates each fortnight. We will cite On-chain datapoints and reference our verifiable Dunes.

The grant will go towards rebates for swaps on Shell. Half of the dollar value of the rebates will come from $SHELL tokens, the other half of the rebate value will come from $ARB tokens.


If the grant is effective, Shell’s volume will increase and we will hit our metrics. If we blow past our targets, then we can continue the rebate program but using 100% $SHELL instead. On the other hand, if the total cost of rebates within a tranche is lower than the amount of $ARB allotted to that tranche, the remaining $ARB will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO.


If the grant is not effective, and we don’t hit our metrics, the Arbitrum DAO will get its money back. That way the DAO takes on minimal risk.


The long-awaited launch of Shell’s governance token $SHELL is expected this December. This will coincide with the launch of the Shell DAO. 
More details here.


Context: Out of 200 million Shell tokens, 40 million are being allocated as pre-TGE incentives via $CRAB (a non-transferable placeholder for $SHELL), and 50 million will be allocated towards post-TGE incentives. There have been three promotional periods so far, each of which lasted several months to a year (the last ongoing) and on average saw 10 million $CRAB distributed across each one.


Grant Breakdown:


100% of the funds will be used to reimburse swap fees on any trade that goes through Shell Protocol.


Rebates will be awarded to all trades starting on TGE and concluding on January 31.

Success metrics: Our goal is to 
5x our DAU and trade volume
 by the end of the promotional period.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


There are two things to consider.


First of all, our vision is for Shell Protocol to be the frontend of DeFi. Currently there is no single place on Arbitrum where a user can access every single DeFi protocol and make complex financial operations in one click. Shell can fill this vacuum. It is an app that can handle 
any set of user operations in DeFi in one atomic transaction
.


Shell’s architecture enables atomic n-to-m swaps. It can currently handle any token including NFTs and LP tokens, meaning users can combine any type of swap with providing/withdrawing liquidity, among other things. At the time of TGE or soon after, these swaps will be able to go through any third party AMM as well as include DeFi operations involving other third party DeFi protocols like lending pools, NFT markets, and more. This will be possible through the new Adapter primitive.


Our plan is to offer rebates on swap fees as an incentive to try out the Shell app, where users can execute any set of trades or DeFi operations in one transaction. This will accompany a big marketing push that coincides with TGE, third party protocol integrations via the Adapter primitive, the launch of new Evolving Proteus pools, and a revamped frontend for the Shell app.


Alongside these 4 milestones, our approach of reimbursing fees will help bring users to Shell, and therefore to Arbitrum. 
It will grow not just Shell’s volume but also the volume of any third party protocols that users interact with through the Shell app.


Despite demonstrated traction in its community and TVL, Shell has had lower volume and DAUs than other DeFi protocols on Arbitrum. Currently, Shell users are limited to trading with Shell pools, which excel for niche/Arbitrum-native tokens and unique pools like NFT AMMs but despite featuring more optimized bonding curves, struggle to match the TVL and therefore reduced slippage offered by older AMMs. With Shell v3 and the Adapter primitive expected to go live at TGE, users will be able to access third party pools as well. This will allow us to realize our vision of Shell as the “frontend of DeFi.”


Under the hood, Shell is also a powerful developer platform. Consequently, the second thing to consider in measuring this grant’s impact in the Arbitrum community is what developers might be encouraged to build using Shell Protocol.


Designing an algorithm that both enables precise liquidity concentration, and can evolve over time in a highly customizable way is not trivial. Solving this problem would significantly accelerate the development of advanced LBPs, NFT LBPs, custom pools for large trades, and other innovative use cases. A solution for this via an Arbitrum-native app, like Evolving Proteus, would especially help spur the launch of new Arbitrum-native NFTs and governance tokens. This would solve yet another problem: the lack of deep liquidity for many tokens on Arbitrum as compared to Ethereum mainnet.


Looking to the future of Arbitrum, 
we believe the big challenge is to support the growth of Arbitrum-native tokens
. Arbitrum-native tokens hold a pivotal role in the growth and sustainability of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Everyone knows liquidity can make or break a protocol in DeFi. However, it is very hard for L2s to compete against Mainnet liquidity for Mainnet-native tokens. In contrast, Arbitrum-native tokens naturally have superior liquidity on Arbitrum. For example, consider Arbitrum’s superior liquidity of $ARB, $GMX, $MAGIC, or $VST. The same principle applies to NFTs as well. Arbitrum struggles to match Ethereum mainnet’s liquidity for collections such as Cryptopunks or Bored Apes; whereas Arbitrum-native NFT collections like Smol Brains, Blueberries, or Government Toucans have deep liquidity. Mainnet’s extensive network effect and entrenched user base create significant barriers for L2s (and alt L1s) to attract enough liquidity to be competitive for established token pairs. In order to attract users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, it is crucial to have Arbitrum-native tokens.


This is the importance of Arbitrum-native innovation. Forked protocols from other chains do nothing to highlight the Arbitrum ecosystem, since users can always find the exact same features on Mainnet or other L2s. 
The best way to attract users and grow the ecosystem is to offer new primitives that only exist on Arbitrum.


Our team is applying for this grant not just because Shell is an Arbitrum-native protocol, but specifically because we want to foster the proliferation of Arbitrum-native tokens—using the next version of Proteus, Shell’s AMM engine. Proteus, like Shell Protocol itself, is an agnostic tool for developers, a public good for the Arbitrum developer ecosystem.


We are about to deploy a new AMM primitive to Arbitrum One: Evolving Proteus (EP). This primitive is a next-generation way to launch new tokens, both fungible tokens and NFTs, natively on Arbitrum. We believe this new tool can help make Arbitrum the best place for launching tokens, and would like to use the ARB incentives program to kick it off with a bang.


Justification for the size of the grant:


Shell Protocol’s contributions to the expansion and enrichment of the Arbitrum ecosystem have been multifaceted and impactful. This strong alliance stretches all the way back to the launch of Shell’s first NFT collection, the Government Toucan. The viral free mint on April 1, 2022 was the biggest day for onboards in Arbitrum history since Arbitrum’s launch—new Toucan users increased the number of wallets on Arbitrum by 3.5% in a single day. The Toucan was the most popular NFT on Arbitrum for many months and to this day, it remains one of the top five PFPs in Arbitrum’s history (ranked by trading volume). Because the mint was a fantastic experience for tens of thousands of Shell users (47,021 addresses), the majority of whom were new to Arbitrum, the Shell team committed to launching Shell v2 as an Arbitrum-native app, and later also launched a second popular NFT collection on Arbitrum, Bro Kwon’s Booty.


The Shell community is now among the top 15 largest and most active communities on Snapshot, but it is the 
#1
 top Snapshot DAO of all Arbitrum-native projects, besides the Arbitrum DAO itself. As a DeFi app, Shell Protocol is currently among the top 10 DEXs on Arbitrum by TVL, and one of the only projects that is building unique and new primitives natively on Arbitrum rather than forking them from other projects and chains. Launched just over one year ago, it is also one of the oldest projects on Arbitrum.


According to the criteria, Shell is eligible for a Siren Grant:




TVL over the past 30 days hovers around $7.6M.


It has been live on Arbitrum for over a year.




We have therefore requested the maximum for this category, 750K ARB.


Execution Strategy:


It’s important that rebates are high enough to encourage users, but not so high as to generate wash trading. Every swap has two cost sources: gas and DEX fees. The goal is for the rebate to cover ~85% of the gas costs and DEX fees.


Rebates will be calculated off-chain, which will allow potential wash trades (if any) to be filtered out of the pool of eligible trades. An off-chain implementation will also allow price APIs, such as CoinGecko, to be used to calculate the proper reward. Periodically, at the end of each month during the promotional period, rebates will be distributed to users.


If the program is effective at growing the Shell ecosystem, volume will increase and we will supplement the rebates with $SHELL tokens. If the program is not effective, there will be more $ARB than needed for rebates, and 
we will return any remaining $ARB to the DAO
.


Risk management: Funds will be held in the ShellDrop multisig and disbursed periodically at the end of each month during the promotional period. Users will be able to claim their earned $ARB the same way they were able to claim $CRAB at the conclusion of Season 1. We will integrate $ARB claims into Shell’s custom interface to streamline this process for users.


Protocol fees: At this time there are no active protocol fees. Wrapping tokens into Shell’s accounting layer, the Ocean, is always free. It is also always free to move your tokens around Shell, whether that means transferring your tokens to other addresses within the Ocean, or using them with various applications in the Shell ecosystem—no matter if you make ten transactions or ten thousand. In the future, when users unwrap tokens to use third party protocols, the DAO may choose to implement a percent fee (currently zero). The maximum fee is capped at 0.05%. It is unlikely the DAO will choose to activate this fee during the promotional period. If the DAO does choose to activate this fee, unwraps that remove tokens from Shell will not be reimbursed.


Pool fees: AMM fees depend on the pool in question. Currently, this is the norm on Shell:




Stable token pools: 0.025%


Volatile token pools: 0.25%




Grant Timeline:


Depending on the start of TGE (as explained above), $ARB incentives will be applied starting sometime between late October and December, and conclude on January 31. Within two weeks following the last day of each month, users will be able to claim their earned rewards.


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?


Yes


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:


Yes


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?:


None, Shell is only on Arbitrum!


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?:


Sep 12, 2022


Protocol Performance:


From December 2022-July 2023 Shell’s TVL has hovered from around $18M to $13M. Only in the past couple months has it declined, but we believe this is a temporary setback due to the broader economic environment.


Protocol:




Average TVL (past 30 days): ~$7.6M


Average daily active users: 360


Cumulative Volume: ~$206M


Number of unique addresses that have interacted with Shell contracts: 39,200 unique addresses




Community:




Total participants in current incentives program: 27,282 wallets


Snapshot community: 43k addresses


Number of Twitter followers: 42.3k


Number of members in the Discord: 47,297




Protocol Roadmap:


By the end of the year, we will hit the long-awaited TGE, establish the $SHELL DAO, and release Shell v3 along with the Adapter primitive and a revamp of the frontend app. In the short term development roadmap, we’re introducing the new Evolving Proteus pools. Considering the release of Shell v3, our token launch, and this killer new version of Proteus, the timing couldn’t be better to team up with Arbitrum on an incentive program.


Evolving Proteus (EP) is a time-evolving version of the Proteus AMM engine. EP builds off of previous work on Proteus, which currently lets teams create custom pools with:




highly precise concentrated liquidity (better capital utilization)


fungible LP tokens


no additional Solidity development required


atomically composable with other Shell primitives




Well-designed, precise bonding curves have better capital utilization and may capture more trade volume than the competition. While this makes Proteus a powerful tool for building static curves, EP can do even more. The name, “Evolving Proteus,” comes from the fact that the AMM’s bonding curve can change and evolve over time.


Under the hood, EP is like a hybrid of Uniswap v3 and Balancer’s liquidity bootstrapping pools (LBPs). Uniswap v3 offers concentrated liquidity, which results in higher capital utilization. LBPs are a type of AMM that work like a Dutch auction, creating liquidity and price discovery for newly launched tokens. LBPs are also MEV-resistant.


EP will enable Dutch auction-style AMMs like Balancer LBPs, but will also have Uniswap v3’s liquidity concentration capability. This results in more efficient token launches, among other benefits.


EP can also be used to create managed pools (similar to Arrakis) with better liquidity concentration. Another use case is that custom EP pools can facilitate large buy or sell orders while minimizing price impact.


In summary, EP would allow teams to rapidly develop:




LBPs


NFT LBPs


Managed pools


Customized pools to facilitate large buy/sell orders


Other innovative projects




Because it is based on Proteus, EP would allow teams to implement any of the above primitives with dramatically improved customizability and fine-tuned curve precision, compared to existing tools.


A note on composability: Proteus is a primitive on Shell Protocol, which means EP can be easily composed with other Shell primitives. Shell is a developer platform and composability solution that lets you make one-click atomic transactions that can combine any set of primitives, like LPing, lending/borrowing, bridging, or token and NFT swaps, and more.


Audit History:


Shell’s contracts have been battle-tested for over a year without a hack. We have just completed an audit of Evolving Proteus with Code4rena and will publish the results in the coming weeks. We completed an 
audit from Trail of Bits in September 2022
.

SECTION 5: Data and Reporting


Is your team prepared to create Dune Dashboards for your incentive program?:


Yes. Some data is available within the Shell App. 
On this screen
 you can find a detailed breakdown of each user’s earned points, as well as a breakdown of TVL per token per pool, 24hr trading volume, and APY. We are currently working on an improved dashboard to better display TVL and volume. Here is a preview:

1190×1410 159 KB


Until now we have been happy with community-created Dune dashboards 
like this one
.


We can certainly develop a custom Dune dashboard to track the incentives program in more detail.


Does your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread?


Yes, we can share dashboard updates along with brief written summaries.


Does your team acknowledge that failure to comply with any of the above requests can result in the halting of the program’s funding stream?:
 Yes"

SECTION 1: APPLICANT INFORMATION


Applicant Name
:


Anton Buenavista


Project Name
:


Pendle


Project Description
:


The Pendle protocol enables permissionless tokenization and trading of yield. Pendle allows anyone to purchase assets at a discount, obtain fixed yield, or long DeFi yield. The protocol enables this by taking yield-bearing tokens and then splitting them into their principal and yield components, PT (principal token) and YT (yield token) respectively, which allows them to be traded via Pendle’s AMM.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size
:


2,000,000 ARB (Lighthouse Grants)


Grant Matching
:


Pendle will continue to incentivize pools with PENDLE via vePENDLE alongside the ARB provided by this grant.


Grant Breakdown
:


The ARB grant will be used and deployed over the course of October 2023 (once it is received) through the end of 31st January 2024 and will be used towards increasing yield trading volume, inciting activity on the platform, deepening liquidity on existing pools as well as an additional incentive for users to bootstrap liquidity for newly listed Pendle markets Arbitrum, and finally to encourage activity on protocols built on top of Pendle. Below is the detailed breakdown:




55% (1,100,000 ARB) will be allocated to the Pendle pools on Arbitrum to deepen liquidity.


40% (800,000 ARB) will be allocated to campaigns to increase activity and trading volume for the Pendle markets on Arbitrum.


5% (100,000 ARB) will be allocated to ecosystem integrations that are integrating the Pendle protocol on Arbitrum.




More details on the grant usage are under Execution Strategy below.


Funding Address
:


0x7877AdFaDEd756f3248a0EBfe8Ac2E2eF87b75Ac


Funding Address Characteristics
:


The funding address is managed by a 2/4 Safe multisig, where each signer is protected with a HW wallet.


Contract Address
:


The actual funding addresses will be automated incentive distribution contracts, which will then be deployed once the grant is approved. These incentive distribution contracts will be funded and managed by the multisig mentioned above.


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives
:


Our prime objective is to use the grant to deepen liquidity and increase the trading volume on Pendle, bolster the Arbitrum ecosystem, and highlight the yield-trading use case on Arbitrum moving forward. To date, Pendle has achieved $46M in TVL, $13M average monthly trading volume, and 6k monthly active users on Arbitrum with no extra external incentives. We aim to leverage the Pendle brand to attract new users and capital inflows into Arbitrum.


Pendle brings the TradFi interest derivative market into DeFi. In traditional finance, interest rate swaps are the biggest market in the world at >$500T. PT is the equivalent of zero-coupon bonds while YT is the equivalent of coupon payments. Pendle is positioning itself to become a core infrastructure for the next phase of DeFi.

1400×515 81.5 KB


By creating yield markets on Arbitrum, Pendle helps unlock the full potential of yield. Pendle enables users to execute advanced yield strategies, such as:




Long assets at a discount


Fixed yield for low-risk, stable growth


Leverage exposure to future yield streams without the need for collateral


A mix of any of the above strategies




We are the only yield-trading protocol, which splits the underlying yield from the principal from a yield-bearing asset, to garner enough traction to put a spotlight on the importance of allowing the market to trade interest rates. Ultimately, Pendle introduces a product necessary for a healthy DeFi ecosystem, and this grant will help accelerate that adoption.

How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
:


We provide a platform for users to speculate and trade on yield for yield-bearing assets in the Arbitrum ecosystem. When we first launched on Arbitrum, we achieved $10.5 million in trading volume in our first month. In the last 7 months of being live on Arbitrum, we have achieved an average trading volume of $12 million and a growth of $45 million in TVL.


As we are a second-order derivatives protocol, Pendle works and integrates existing yield-bearing assets, such as GLP, gDAI, Camelot LPs, wstETH, etc., in order to allow users to trade the yield. This allows Pendle to be significantly synergistic with other existing protocols as we rely on DeFi’s principle of composability to enrich the overarching DeFi landscape on Arbitrum. To date, we have listed 12 pools across 8 Arbitrum protocols namely Lido, GMX, Gains Network, RocketPool, Camelot, HMX, Stargate, and Penpie with more incoming as we list more protocol pools.


We aim to leverage Pendle’s brand and extensive community to further grow of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Therefore, we have some planned collaborations, listings, and product developments in the pipeline which will help further invigorate the yield-trading sector on Arbitrum. As we are the only yield-trading avenue on Arbitrum, we expect users to use and interact with Arbitrum through Pendle even after exhausting the ARB incentives due to the financial opportunities available to trade the yield on Pendle.


Justification for the size of the grant
:


While Pendle is known to be the premier yield trading platform on Arbitrum, not many in the Arbitrum ecosystem are familiar with the concept of trading the yield or interest rates. We believe getting a grant from the DAO can help further accelerate our traction there. The size of the requested grant is to ensure the pools on Pendle have a yield that is modestly above the underlying pool’s yield as well as to kickstart additional trading activity through campaigns and quests as described in the earlier sections above. Ultimately, this grant may kickstart a flywheel where users who are initially unfamiliar with the yield trading DeFi primitive would be encouraged to try it out. The expected end result is an increased awareness and usage of yield trading, an overall increase of yield trading volume and TVL, new DeFi use cases via builders building new integrations on top of Pendle, and DeFi strategies that make use of Pendle and other protocols on Arbitrum which further enhances the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem.


We believe that our track record, commitment to Arbitrum, and the value that this grant can create for the Arbitrum ecosystem justify the size of the grant requested. To date, over 3.45M PENDLE emissions have been utilized towards Arbitrum. Pendle will continue to support the Arbitrum ecosystem with PENDLE emissions moving forward.


Execution Strategy
:


Our execution strategy is divided into three categories:




Pendle Pools




1,100,000 ARB (55% of the total grant size) will be allocated to the Pendle pools on Arbitrum to deepen liquidity.


The allocated grant will be divided across the different pools on Pendle. Specifically, the 1,100,00 ARB will equally be divided across several epochs (an epoch lasts one week starting and ending at Thursday 00:00 UTC) starting from receipt of the grant up until the end of the program on 31st January 2024.


There are currently 12 pools across 8 Arbitrum protocols to date and are being incentivized with PENDLE via vePENDLE. Each pool per epoch will receive the allocated grant based on the vePENDLE vote weight the pool has respective to the total voting weight on Arbitrum. This encourages users to vote for the Arbitrum pools across the different networks overall, and therefore a pool’s allocation of ARB incentives may change every epoch.


As each pool is essentially an integration with a yield-bearing asset, Pendle will work closely with the Arbitrum partner protocols Lido, GMX, Gains Network, RocketPool, Camelot, HMX, Stargate, and Penpie with more incoming as we list more protocol pools (such as Kyber’s axlwstETH/wstETH Elastic pool) to highlight these incentives.






Pendle
 
Campaigns




800,000 ARB (40% of the total grant size) will be allocated to campaigns to increase activity and trading volume for the Pendle markets on Arbitrum.


At least one campaign per month will be done to keep things fresh and to entice users to keep trying out the campaigns.


Campaigns may include:



A seasonal trading campaign that takes advantage of Pendle’s newly released Leaderboard feature, the beta as seen here: 
https://app.pendle.finance/trade/dashboard/leaderboard/valuation
. The top transacted volume and net P&L will receive the ARB rewards. This encourages users to explore yield trading and devise strategies to be on top of the leaderboard. Overall, we should expect a growth in volume and user activity from this trading campaign.


A trading campaign making use of Pendle’s upcoming Limit Order feature. Limit order makers and/or takers will be incentivized with ARB rewards as we expect this to push for more adoption of Pendle’s limit order system, which overall improves liquidity for yield trading and yield trading adoption in the Arbitrum ecosystem in general.


Pendle’s Campaign page, which is a page in our dapp that features task-based quests a user must fulfill in order to earn rewards, as seen here: 
https://app.pendle.finance/campaigns
. The team will work on Arbitrum-specific creative campaigns that will fuel excitement on Arbitrum. In addition, Pendle will work with other partner protocols on the campaigns to spur activity across the different DeFi protocols from users. Several campaigns will be planned throughout the duration of October 2023 to the end of January 2024.










Pendle Integrations




100,000 ARB (5% of the total grant size) will be allocated for users to explore ecosystem integrations that have integrated the Pendle protocol on Arbitrum.


Protocols that have integrated Pendle on Arbitrum (such as making use of Pendle’s PTs, YTs, or LPs in some way) is a great way to introduce the rest of what the greater DeFi ecosystem has to offer to our community. Users who make further use of their Pendle assets on other Pendle integrations will be able to receive this allocated portion of the grant as additional rewards in order to encourage users to make further use of the Pendle assets that they hold. Users can perform actions such as use PTs as collateral to borrow against in a lending protocol. Not only does this highlight DeFi’s composability across different protocols, but it further encourages users to explore the burgeoning DeFi landscape on Arbitrum. On-chain actions made by users will be tallied on a monthly basis and be rewarded accordingly.








A distribution contract will be used to facilitate the distribution of the ARB grant across the three categories above.


Grant Timeline
:


The ARB grant will start being distributed within 7 days of the receipt of the first payment. The program will continue until all ARB is spent up until 31st January 2024. The multisig used at the funding address mentioned above is an operational multisig that can act reasonably quickly. It will work to try to ensure that rewards are claimed and schedules are loaded in sufficient time to prevent any gaps in emissions.


For each category (as specified above), the following will be the execution timeline:




Pendle Pools
 — 55% of the bi-weekly funding will be loaded on a distribution contract for Pendle pools every epoch.


Pendle Campaigns
 — 40% of the bi-weekly funding will be saved and then deployed in a distribution contract once a Pendle campaign is live.


Pendle Integrations
 — 5% of the bi-weekly funding will be loaded into a distribution contract that will disburse rewards monthly based on user activity on Pendle integrated protocols.




Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?


Yes


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?

LPing into Pendle requires you to interact with the underlying protocol to acquire the yield-bearing asset or position. Our pools are comprised of the underlying against the Principal Token. For example, in the case of the Pendle PT-Stargate-USDT pool, it would be Stargate-USDT/PT-Stargate-USDT. Therefore, when depositing into the Pendle pool using USDT, you’d need to interact with the Stargate USDT to first add liquidity into the Stargate USDT pool and then stake that LP into their farm.


With the launch of different Pendle pools on Arbitrum, we’ve helped deepen the underlying protocol’s liquidity as Pendle tokenizes either the yield-bearing asset or the yield-bearing position. Over time, we have managed to own a majority of the liquidity from the underlying protocol. Some of the key contributions include:




Arbitrum’s rETH pool: 35% liquidity owned, grew liquidity by 57% since launch


Camelot’s ARB-GRAIL pool: 51% liquidity owned, grew liquidity by 234% since launch


Camelot’s PENDLE-ETH pool: 70% liquidity owned


Stargate’s USDT Arbitrum pool: 10% liquidity owned

Protocol Roadmap

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size:


500,000 ARB


Grant Matching:


N/A


Grant Breakdown:


100% of the grant
 will be used to the following purpose. We aim to bolster user participation and community engagement on Arbitrum through XY Finance and our own bridge called Y Pool by reimbursing bridge fee occurring amid the transfer and migration to Arbitrum.




Reduce the net cost for end users to onboard to Arbitrum




End users that utilize XY Finance to migrate their liquidity on other chains or transfer assets on other chains to Arbitrum will get bridge fee rebate, 
worth 90% of their onboarding fees
.  It’s extremely straightforward and user-friendly. Each ARB will be used to subsidize each to-Arbitrum transaction and lower threshold of inflowing liquidity into Arbitrum.


By doing so, we are sure that XY Finance can tackle 2 major problems for users:




High onboarding cost for user (gas fee + bridge fee)


The friction associated with the whole onboarding journey filled with multiple steps




Funding Address:


(
GnosisSafeProxy | Address 0x4a4Cb50A1026D5C154eDcD4C3A664cc63a773d50 | Arbiscan
)


Funding Address Characteristics:


Address given above is a 2/3 Gnosis Multisignature wallet. The private keys are securely stored.


Distribution Contract Address:


Specific contracts will be deployed before rebate campaign start and will be publicly available. Initially, the funds will be securely kept in XY Finance’s multisig wallet.


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives:


Reduce the net cost for end users to onboard to Arbitrum by tackling the following two major problems: High onboarding cost for user (gas fee + bridge fee) and the cumbersome onboarding process.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):


500,000 ARB (410,000 USD calculated by $0.82 per ARB) of this grant plan is to incentivize bridging volume of to-Arbitrum routes from competing ecosystems to hit 650,793,650.79 ~ 911,111,111.11 USD, which is calculated by the current industrial bridge fee rate (0.05%~0.07%.)


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


The objective of the token distribution is to supercharge our mission of making cross-chain easier and user onboarding Arbitrum. The token distribution eliminates one of the biggest problems hindering user onboarding & protocol to create an accessible & prosperous Arbitrum ecosystem.


By tackling the user onboarding problems, we can further support the Arbitrum user base expansion. We do the first step to attract users and inflow the liquidity. Arbitrum partners will do the second step to keep liquidity, serve newcomers, and convert them to loyal Arbitrum users.


Justification for the size of the grant:


This grant targets the importation of $650~$911 million of liquidity migration to the Arbitrum economy, which can make transfer liquidity into Arbitrum very cheap, which is much less than the average gas cost of competing ecosystems. Rewards target to subsidize 90% of the bridge cost of each to-Arbitrum transfer. This reward is meant to be distributed when the real user transfers the liquidity from the competing ecosystems to Arbitrum. That’s to say, only Arbitrum believers can get the rewards. What’s more, the rewards will continuously subsidize the users to support their liquidity migration until the grants are fully distributed without a specific deadline. At the time of writing, 500,000 ARB is expected to boost the liquidity migration of up to $911 million.


Execution Strategy:


XY Finance will see 100% of the allocated grant distributed as bridging subsidy that will be distributed fully to end users who utilize XY Finance to migrate their liquidity to Arbitrum. A distribution contract will be updated weekly with ARB token rewards, and the allowance for each address. End users can freely claim ARB rewards anytime.


Grant Timeline:


From time of first tranche receipt, estimated timeline:




Announcement of rewards program and building awareness: 2 weeks


Build, test, deploy rewards contract & UI: 2 weeks


Incentive period: it depends on the trading volume and it is first come first served.


Prepare report on grant plan results: 4 weeks (requires 30 days’ data post grant)




SECTION 5: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Provide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?:

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size
: 200,000 ARB


Grant Matching
: N/A


Grant Breakdown
:


$ARB credit by the people, should be for the people.


All of our grant funding will be dedicated to effectively incentivizing the acquisition of new users and driving growth in trading volume both on Arbitrum and JOJO through a variety of targeted campaigns.






Airdrop for users who are the first time on Arbitrum - 40% of $ARB grant


JOJO offers liquidity, low fees, and a top-of-the-line matching engine, with professional features like sub-accounts and grid trading. We’re bringing people into the decentralized exchange space with our first airdrop from the Arbitrum ecosystem project.


Our mission is to provide a trustworthy gateway to the Arbitrum ecosystem, powered by JOJO while leveraging perpdex and 40% $ARB rewards to incentivize new users. We will implement a set of criteria to encourage new user activities. With our platform, they can experience the benefits of decentralized exchanges in a secure and transparent trading environment and increase their potential for profits.






Orderbook pool incentive - 40% of $ARB grant


JOJO offers 5 permanent trading pairs. Monthly $ARB bonus distribution in order book pools is based on each pair’s trading volume. We give our users 40% of the $ARB profit earned by the protocol as a thank-you for their trust. Traders in a pool receive a share of the $ARB bonus as a prize.






Trading fee rebate - 15% of $ARB grant


JOJO offers a 15% rebate on fees in $ARB to our valued users. We ensure that all Arbitrum traders have access to this advantage, regardless of their trading frequency or transaction fees.






“JOJO’s Bizarre Adventure” campaign - 5% of $ARB grant


We launched a campaign with 12 quests to promote JOJO’s features and boost engagement on Arbitrum. Our evolving points and rebate system will offer great benefits to users who explore JOJO’s functionalities.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives
:


JOJO’s primary objective is to drive user growth. This objective can be broken down into three key metrics: user number, trading volume, and total value locked (TVL).




User number




JOJO is committed to growing its user base. The platform is developing new features to attract new users, such as a multi-collateral system that accepts liquid staking and unstable tokens as collateral, subaccount, and grid trading bot infrastructure. These features will make JOJO more attractive to a wider range of users and help the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem thrive.




Trading volume




As a perpetual contract trading platform, trading volume is a straightforward metric to measure the popularity of an exchange. An increase in trading volume indicates increased activity and engagement on JOJO, which can attract more users and liquidity. We have already launched the “JOJO’s Bizarre Adventure” campaign to attract users to trade and complete quests. With the grant program, JOJO has greater flexibility to incentivize traders and subsidize trading fees, which will further motivate traders to use the platform.




TVL




Total value locked (TVL) is also a crucial metric for measuring user growth on JOJO. TVL represents the total amount of assets locked in decentralized finance protocols, including JOJO. As JOJO attracts more users and liquidity, the TVL will increase, indicating the platform’s growth and popularity within the DeFi ecosystem.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
:




Number of new traders onboarded: 200 DAU


Growth of trading volume: 20M




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
:


We plan to expand our reach beyond the Arbitrum ecosystem by utilizing JOJO’s various benefits, including its liquidity, user-friendly interface, advanced features like sub-accounts and grid bot, and email login option. Furthermore, JOJO’s low fees, multi-asset collateral capabilities, and high liquidity will also aid in our growth within the decentralized financial ecosystem of Arbitrum.


When it comes to decentralized exchanges, users are often worried about liquidity and a smooth trading experience. However, JOJO, an order book perpetual contract exchange, is here to alleviate those concerns for Arbinauts. JOJO allows for fast and efficient trading with deep liquidity that rivals centralized exchanges. Plus, the exchange’s low fees mean users can save on transaction costs and attract more participants. JOJO also offers a multi-asset collateral feature, which gives Arbinauts more options for 0-interest lending and investment strategies.


JOJO offers advanced features such as sub-account and grid bot functionalities. With the sub-account feature, users can manage multiple accounts at the same time, and each account is isolated from others in terms of risk. This helps users manage their assets based on different investment strategies. The grid bot provides users with more profit opportunities and financial choices in a consolidating market, allowing them to gain more returns in volatile market conditions.


Arbitrum’s decentralized exchange space is set to experience a significant surge in user traffic with the arrival of JOJO. This growth is poised to bolster the decentralized financial ecosystem and create more avenues for users to make profits.


Justification for the size of the grant
:


JOJO has been live on the Arbitrum network for two months. During this time, we have been dedicated to building new features and DeFi infrastructure for the Arbitrum ecosystem. Our efforts have achieved an astonishing trading volume of $77 million in the Sep 2023, far exceeding the requirements suggested by the Arbitrum Incentives Working Group for the Beacon Grant.


Although JOJO is still an early protocol on Arbitrum, it has tremendous potential for growth. JOJO offers a wide range of features as an order book without the need for spot reserves. In addition to our multi-asset collateral feature allowing zero-interest borrowing and lending with assets like WETH, wstETH, ARB, GMX, and more, JOJO’s highly flexible sub-account system is one of our core functionalities. Furthermore, our neutral strategy contract trading robot has been launched, and we will continue to develop more features based on user demand on Arbitrum.


At the same time, the JOJO team emphasizes the code security of the protocol and provides a high-quality trading experience for users. In terms of code security, we have conducted a public audit contest with Sherlock and established bug bounty programs for JOJO’s smart contracts and web interface on Immunefi and HackenProof. JOJO will continue to conduct code reviews and security testing to ensure the safety of users’ funds and transaction data.


In addition to security, we are constantly improving and optimizing the trading experience. We are committed to providing a fast, reliable, and user-friendly trading environment to meet the needs of our users. Our user interface is clean, intuitive, and easy to use, while also offering a wealth of features that enable users to trade effortlessly and explore more DeFi opportunities.


Till now, JOJO has not conducted any public fundraising, but it has developed many trading features on the Arbitrum ecosystem that other PerpDex platforms do not have, accumulating a significant trading volume. Instead of directly incentivizing mature projects with $ARB, we believe it is the duty of DAO voters to reevaluate smaller-scale but highly potential projects and teams within the Arbitrum ecosystem and support their growth and development.


Execution Strategy
: [Describe the plan for executing including resources, products, use of funds, and risk management. This includes allocations for specific pools, eligible assets, products, etc.]


If the DAO approves JOJO’s proposal, the $ARB token will be sent to the funding address, and allocated to users based on different timelines.






Airdrop for users who are the first time on Arbitrum - 40% of $ARB grant


We will allocate 80,000 $ARB to incentivize new users on Arbitrum since we believe numerous users from CEX still haven’t migrated to the defi space.


JOJO will create a set of criteria to encourage new users’ activities, measurements include TVL on the multi-collateral system, trading volume, and the number of trades made on JOJO. We will check the eligibility for the accounts at the end of the incentive campaign and distribute rewards.






Order book pool incentive - 40% of $ARB grant


We will allocate $80,000 $ARB to our 5 permanent trading pairs’ order book pool, including BTC-USD, ETH-USD, ARB-USD, SOL-USD, and LINK-USD. The incentive will not be evenly distributed to these pools. Instead, JOJO is planning to allocate the incentive based on the monthly trading volume of each pair.


In other words, traders could team up with other traders in the community and boost the rank of a specific trading pair to secure a higher amount of reward. This design can bring healthy community competition and generate more activities on the Arbitrum network.






Trading fee rebate - 15% of $ARB grant


We will allocate 30,000 $ARB as a trading fee rebate for the users and we will evenly distribute the rebate over 4 months. If the total gas expense is less than 7,500 $ARB, we will fully refund the trading fee rebate to traders and roll over the remaining to the next month. If the total gas expense is higher than 7,500 $ARB, we will rebate the trading fee in proportion to the traders.






“JOJO’s Bizarre Adventure” campaign - 5% of $ARB grant


We will distribute the 10,000 $ARB to the campaign participants after the incentive period, based on the number of quests they have finished and the total points they have collected.

Protocol Roadmap
:


Next Step - The Absolute Decentralization V2.X: Diamond Is Unbreakable Era


The decentralized insurance fund: Allowing users to top up a variety of assets (including various interest-bearing assets) as an insurance fund to protect the platform trader’s profit redemption.


The decentralized market making: Allowing users to select a market maker account and provide them with a margin. Users can share the profit and bear the loss from the market-making proceeds. Market makers (and their LPs) who perform well will be rewarded with platform tokens.


The decentralized funding rate: In situations where transactions occur frequently, the funding rate will be determined using a zero-knowledge proof that relies solely on on-chain transaction data instead of being calculated centrally based on the mid-price.


The decentralized matching engine: It is possible to build a POS system for a matching engine, transforming JOJO into a fully decentralized trading platform for perpetual contracts.


Tokenomics: JOJO plans to decentralize governance and provide additional utility by launching a governance token in the future. Details will be disclosed once tokenomics is settled.

SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives:


The principal aim of this grant is to empower the fortification of the position of the GMD Ecosystem and help enhance the attractiveness and competitiveness of Arbitrum across the DeFi space. focusing primarily on the following strategic objectives:






Significantly Increase Total Value Locked (TVL)






Expand User Base






Elevate User Interaction and Engagement on Arbitrum






Increase Trading Volume on Arbitrum






GMD Objectives: Strengthening Existing GLP Liquidity, Expanding to Deepen liquidity for GMX V2 Vaults




GLP delta-neutral vaults incentives (45% of 450-600k $ARB)






We will use $ARB to incentivize our GLP-based vaults for users who provide our vaults with USDC, USDT, BTC, and ETH assets. This is to subsidize and further build on the underlying revenue-generating GLP assets of GMD Protocol.


The GLP Delta-neutral Vaults have been one of our core products throughout our entire existence and have always been able to attract a large amount of sticky liquidity. Even with the growing popularity of GMX V2, the demands of GLP for providing seamless large-volume trades would remain persistent


As such, the stability and enduring presence of GLP in the ecosystem make it a reliable choice for incentives, ensuring sustained relevance and continuous contribution to the ecosystem’s growth.


The inherent sticky liquidity within GLP vaults suggests that assets, once deposited, are likely to remain, providing a constant and stable source of liquidity, crucial for the stability and growth of GMD Protocol and the entire ecosystem.






GMX V2 delta-neutral vaults incentives (55% of 450-600k $ARB)






GMX V2 is experiencing substantial growth, and the allocation of incentives can further accelerate this, providing an impetus for more users and liquidity to flow into the ecosystem.


Our GMX V2 delta-neutral vaults are in development phase (learn more 
through this Medium article
) and is expected to be ready around early October


The vaults in GMX V2 are generating significant APR, acting as a magnet for liquidity providers and investors seeking optimum yield on their assets, thus enriching the user base of GMD, GMX, and Arbitrum as a whole


As we have seen with GLP vaults, we believe GMX V2 vaults will also attract very sticky liquidity, and the entirety of the grants will be to bootstrap and welcome said liquidity to deposits into our vaults, as high liquidity is pivotal for reducing slippage and improving transaction efficiency, enhancing the overall user experience.




GND Objectives: Fostering Sustainability and Resilience, Deepening UniV3 Trading Liquidity for Arbitrum, Solving Inefficiencies.


The GND protocol was launched at the end of April with the main goal to leverage Uniswap v3 LPs to create capital-efficient systems. In just four months, we’ve achieved remarkable milestones, like:




Amassing over $1.5 million in revenue in 4 months


Aligning different incentive programs to push locking of liquid token. Our supply decrease by 30% since genesis.


TVL consistently exceeding 10 million.




However, we’ve encountered some challenges along the way, including a decrease in Crypto and DeFi Volume, and challenges with LP ranges. As we transition to GNDv2, it represents a quantum leap from its predecessor.


GNDv2 Features:




Streamlined Emission Management: Removing xGND voting for pools streamlines the process of adjusting incentives, enhancing efficiency for LPs with higher fees.


Dynamic Emission Adjustment: GNDv2 adapts emissions to market conditions, reducing inflation during low-volume periods and attracting more liquidity when activity increases.


Partnership Expansion: Partnering with platforms like Kyberswap diversified revenue streams and leverages their incentive programs to generate higher revenue.


Resumed Buybacks: Ensuring project sustainability with buybacks during revenue declines, benefiting xGND takers as activity and volume recover.




With the basis for GNDv2 set and already being executed, the $ARB we apply for will go towards liquidity incentives to amplify the liquidity pools on GND Farm. We are targeting an increase of $10 million in actively used UniswapV3 liquidity.

How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


For GMD:




Enhancement of Yield and Liquidity:






Optimized Yield Opportunities: The grant will enable GMD to develop and offer more optimized and diverse yield-generating opportunities, attracting a broader user base and encouraging more deposits into the protocol. This will, in turn, create a cycle of sustainable value creation and distribution within the ecosystem.


Ecosystem Synergy: Increased yield and liquidity will foster symbiotic relationships with other protocols and services within Arbitrum, enhancing interoperability and collaborative innovations, and contributing to a more cohesive and robust liquidity landscape within Arbitrum






Attraction of Stable and Long-term Liquidity:






Sticky Liquidity Provision: The grant will empower GMD to create attractive and competitive liquidity pools, drawing in ‘sticky’ liquidity – long-term, stable funds from investors and users who are committed to the vaults for sustainable yield.


Enhanced User Confidence: Attracting stable liquidity will reinforce user confidence and trust in the protocol, creating a reliable and secure platform for users to interact with. This strengthened reliability can encourage more prolonged and substantial engagement from users not just for GMD but for Arbitrum collectively


Sustainable Growth Foundation: The infusion of stable and consistent liquidity will lay down a solid foundation for sustainable growth and expansion of GMD within Arbitrum. It will enable the continual refinement and introduction of innovative solutions and services, fostering an evolving and adaptive ecosystem that caters to diverse users trading and yield services needs.




For GND:




Liquidity Provision:








GND Protocol has a backstage role in hosting large Uniswap V3 liquidity and volume. Here’s a snapshot of GND’s liquidity contribution to Arbitrum’s most influential protocols:


800×500 144 KB

At an average of 1% fee, GND’s $1,500,000 in revenue means we have hosted an est. $150,000,000 in volume.






As most DeFi users use Uniswap as their go-to dex, we’re able to directly influencing the trading experience for most Arbitrum participants.






The distribution of $ARB, in the case that our proposal goes through, will form a system where value is transferred between users and LPs. The transition between various user bases:








LPs will earn $ARB incentives for their participation.


LPs will recoup fees through staking xGND.


The value will be transferred to Arbitrum users, the majority of whom use UniswapV3.






In light of the challenging times marked by low DeFi TVL and yields, there’s a concerning reverse flywheel effect where users are increasingly unstaking their LPs, making liquidity thinner for swappers. The Arb grant becomes a beacon of hope in these trying times, injecting much-needed vitality into the ecosystem. GND’s continued commitment and strategic allocation of resources will play a pivotal role in reversing this trend and revitalizing liquidity on Arbitrum, ensuring a more vibrant and sustainable DeFi landscape for all participants.




Justification for the size of the grant:


Currently, GMD Ecosystem projects, including GMD and GND Protocol, collectively boast a total of over 21 million in TVL and we have just surpassed one year since our initial deployment on Arbitrum.


Other than TVL metrics, we also have a strong dedication towards Real-Yield generation, which would in turn create positive-sum yields for our users and the Arbitrum ecosystem. Over the course of GMD and GND existence, we have distributed close to 1000 $WETH in revenue generated from our yield products and services:




For GMD: we distributed more than 317 $WETH in real-yield revenue for our stakers


For GND: we distributed more than 640 $WETH in real-yield revenue for our stakers




Execution Strategy:


For GMD:




GLP and GMX V2 Vault Incentivization:



We will build out a contract on top of the underlying delta-neutral vaults that will enable $ARB emissions for users who deposit their assets into the vaults. The $ARB emissions will have stable and attractive APR to last through the end of the incentives period








For GND:




Incentivizing Liquidity



In a situation-dependent but diligent approach, we allocate Arbitrum (Arb) to the pool generating the highest fees, thus optimizing incentives for fee generation.

Incentives will exclusively be assigned to markets that satisfy the following criteria:


Utilization of dependable price oracles.








Grant Timeline:


Our plan for both GMD and GND Protocol is to distribute the incentives linearly over a 3.5 months period, starting October 15, 2023 and ending January 31, 2024.

What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?


GMD Protocol products and services have been present on Arbitrum since September 2022. GND Protocol products and services have been present on Arbitrum since February 2023.


Protocol Performance and Roadmap:


For GMD:


Throughout our past year of existence, GMD Protocol has been one of the leaders in the Arbitrum ecosystem, showcasing a relentless commitment to innovation and user-centric services. As the dominant player in the delta-neutral vaults market on Arbitrum, we have also shown an extreme focus on sustainable Real-Yield generation and how well we are able to do so. We have been able to achieve the following:




Our GLP Vaults, a pivotal component of GMD, has been one of the largest and most efficient vaults services available on Arbitrum. The vaults service has solidified its position as a leading vault provider on Arbitrum and currently managing ~$10 million in TVL. Our GMX V2 Vaults will expect to vastly increase the existing TVL.


GMD also places a strong focus in the real-yield narrative. It has efficiently generated and distributed 320 WETH in real-yield dividends to stakers


GMD’s introduction of incubator and launchpad programs has played a crucial role in the development and sustenance of multiple projects, channeling millions in volume into Arbitrum




For GND:




Maximizing Arbitrum’s Liquidity Landscape: We have proudly contributed 10% of all Uniswap liquidity on Arbitrum, surpassing the liquidity provision of many other protocols. This substantial presence not only enhances our protocol’s performance but also bolsters Arbitrum’s overall liquidity, offering users a richer and more efficient trading experience.(

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size:

2,000,000 ARB Tokens


Grant Breakdown:

Stargate has seen an average of $700m of monthly volume into Arbitrum over the past 5 months, being a key facilitator of liquidity injection into Arbitrum. The grant will be used, in its entirety, to rebate bridging fees for users who are bridging into Arbitrum over the Incentive Program period. This will ensure that users who are looking to participate in the Arbitrum ecosystem throughout the Incentive Program have a reliable, subsidized way of bringing liquidity to the overall ecosystem.


This grant will subsidize up to an estimated $2.7B of volume (based on standard protocol fees of 0.06%) across the 4 months of this program. This is roughly equivalent to the amount of volume Stargate has seen into Arbitrum in the past 4 months. The incentive subsidy will also therefore always be lower than total fees, providing an incentive to utilise this service, but not abuse it. Additionally, the subsidy is provided for bridging 
into
 Arbitrum, not 
out of
.


Any funds not distributed by the 01/31/2024 cut-off date will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO Treasury (0xf3fc178157fb3c87548baa86f9d24ba38e649b58).


Funding Address:

Stargate Finance: Multisig - 
0x9CD50907aeb5D16F29Bddf7e1aBb10018Ee8717d


Funding Address Characteristics:

3/6 multisig, with private keys securely stored.


Contract Address:

Grants funds will be sent from above-mentioned multisig to a purpose-built smart contract that will stream fee rebates to wallets that have bridged into Arbitrum. This smart contract will be deployed if/when grant is approved, and the address will be disclosed within governance forums and prominently displayed within the Dashboard built for this program


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives:




To incentivise liquidity bridging into Arbitrum


To reduce fee barriers for net new users wanting to explore Arbitrum


To contribute to the success of other recipients of this grant


Ultimately the goal is to make it as easy as possible for users to participate in the wider Arbitrum ecosystem.




Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)




The number of unique wallets that receive a subsidized bridge into Arbitrum.


The number of net new wallets that bridge into Arbitrum (fresh address)


An analysis of how users elect to use funds they have bridged into Arbitrum through this Incentive Program (i.e. what are the next 3-5 transactions for each wallet)



Success would be seeing the majority of users bridging into Arbitrum through Stargate participating in other Incentive Programs, and other protocols








How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?

In 2023, Stargate volume has picked up significantly into Arbitrum, commensurate with the growth in TVL and stablecoin market cap on the chain. Stargate’s goal through receiving this grant is to allow for significant growth to the ecosystem. Stargate is already well known as the dominant bridge to use for bringing liquidity into Abitrum, and merely hopes to provide users with a cheaper experience throughout this program. Ultimately, this will ensure users have more funds to explore exciting quests, incentives programs and protocol launches.


Justification for the size of the grant:

Stargate is eligible for the Pinnacle size grant, as the 4th largest protocol (by TVL) on Arbitrum, and typically 2nd largest by daily volume.




Has been live for 18 months on Arbitrum


Has >$700M in 30D Volume


Has ~$100M in TVL on Arbitrum




Stargate is also uniquely positioned as the largest bridge to Arbitrum to provide users with a significant amount of liquidity to participate in both Arbitrum Odyssey and the full Incentive Program. The amount of volume Stargate has done, as well as it’s TVL of ~$100M, is testament to Stargate being a source of sticky liquidity on Arbitrum.


Execution Strategy:

The execution strategy involves using 100% of the grant allocation to subsidize bridging fees for users (by rebating 0.06% of volume, equivalent to the protocol fee on Stargate). This will include all pooled assets on the core Stargate protocol: USDC, USDT and ETH.


The smart contract to stream these funds to users will be developed and deployed by technical contributors to Stargate, and will also be audited. Users will not incur any costs, and will not have to retroactively claim these rebates. Once the grant is approved and funds are received, Stargate will communicate on Twitter as well as in governance threads on the commencement date and time of the rebates.


Grant Timeline:

This grant will be streamed to the above-mentioned Stargate Finance: Multisig throughout the duration of the STIP. The grant will expire when either all 2,000,000 ARB have been distributed to users, or the 01/31/24 deadline is hit, upon which the remainder will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO Treasury.


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?

Yes

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size
: 4M ARB


Teem
: Till end of January


Grant Breakdown
: Grant will be used to incentivise liquidity around wstETH on the Arbitrum network. wstETH already trades on multiple venues on Arbitrum like Kyber, Curve, Uniswap, Balancer etc. Maintaining liquidity on key venues is important for maintaining utility of the wstETH asset.


Funding Address
: arb1:0x1840c4D81d2C50B603da5391b6A24c1cD62D0B56


Funding Address Characteristics
: 4/6 multisig


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Clearly outline the primary objectives of the project and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the project aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.


Objectives
:


The first objective is maintaining and improving wstETH liquidity on Arbitrum DEXes vs ETH and stables


The long-term objective, however, is allowing users to mint stETH natively on Arbitrum. This would make Arbitrum the first L2 to allow that, and would be a huge vote of support from Lido to Arbitrum.


However, to achieve that, there needs to be sufficient onchain liquidity for whales to buy/sell and to borrow vs their holdings on Aave. This has been the feedback hence this grant is targeting liquidity and supply caps.


I personally think getting this grant passed will mark a new page in Lido x Arbitrum relationship as ecosystems. It can become be the first step towards achieving native minting on Arbitrum, but it starts with this grant.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
:




TVL across DEXes, 2% depth trade size and volumes.


Increase supply caps for wstETH on lending protocols




How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
:


DEX liquidity


Screenshot 2023-09-26 at 10.00.59
968×772 48.4 KB


wstETH has benefitted from very high liquidity on Arbitrum in the past. It has contributed to the Arbitrum ecosystem as well by enabling efficient LST trading, which is something mostly associated with mainnet.


This can be clearly seen from very competitive slippage on ETH → wstETH vs cbETH and rETH:


Swapping 1000 ETH → wstETH: -0.01% slippage


Swapping 1000 ETH → cbETH: -4.24% slippage


Swapping 1000 ETH → rETH: -0.16% slippage


However, to preserve the utility of wstETH on Arbitrum, more incentives may be required in the future. This will enable native LSTfi products to develop natively on Arbitrum such as Ethena, Raft, Gravita etc.


Lending Markets

A popular trade in DeFi is looping stETH rewards vs ETH via lending protocols. When that happens or the trade gets unwound, wstETH/WETH buys and sells are routed via DEXes. It is crucial that liquidity is maintained for these trades to occur.


Also, if Arbitrum wants supply caps increased on its lending markets, it requires high onchain liquidity to get risk houses like Chaos labs and Gauntlet onboard. From this perspective, Arbitrum and Lido are well-aligned to foster favourable liquidity conditions for wstETH.


Similarly, various yield-enhancing dapps like Instadapp rely on these looping strategies. Favourable liquidity brings them onboard as well.


Native minting on Arbitrum

The combination of high DEX liquidity, adoption across verticals like lending, yield optimisers etc can lead to Lido DAO allowing native stETH minting on Arbitrum. This is a long-term goal and requires sizeable stETH holders to be more comfortable with L2s, but is in line with the L2-dominated feature of the ETH ecosystem.


Justification for the size of the grant
: wstETH has a TVL of $130mil on Arbitrum, which is huge. It’s the most popular asset on lending markets and trades actively on DEXes.


Execution Strategy
: The funds will be handled by the Liquidity Committee within Lido DAO. It will pursue the objective of maintaining and improving wstETH/WETH and wstETH/USD liquidity on suitable DEX venues and deposits on lending protocols.

Protocol Roadmap
: Lido will continue to prioritise liquidity across trading venues. The next big item is community staking, whereby node operators will be able to join Lido permissionlessly, and hence further decentralise the protocol.


Another item on the roadmap is minting stETH natively on other L2s like Arbitrum. With sufficient liquidity and partnerships, Lido could enable Arbitrum users to do that. This would be a huge deal for the future of L2s.


I cannot stress enough how impactful that would be, but it requires a tighter partnership between Lido and Arbitrum.

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Detail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.


Requested Grant Size: 1M [updated amount]


Grant Breakdown:


150k for Multi-Chain / Fiat Onboarding




Vela Exchange was among the first projects to POC and launch a multi-chain deposit and LP minting integration with Squid/Axelar


We are improving the UX and planning to incentivize users who bridge and trade / provide LP


Fiat onboard/offboarding integrations are also being optimized and we wish to add an incentive to utilize our fiat integrations in the form of $ARB tokens




400k for Social Features / Trading Leagues




We building a trading league system that will offer $ARB / $esVELA rewards - this system will connect into the other social features of Vela Exchange, including social profiles, profile tracking, etc


Our team is also integrating social platforms including Discord, Telegram, Twitter throughout the platform to increase trader retention and build upon the community we have created - we wish to improve on social sharing with small incentives per action


Trading leagues will have a cap on incentives based on fees earned to prevent any wash trading → this is further prevented by being focused on PnL, although volume may play a factor




100k for Bot / Automated Trading Incentives




We are the 2nd DEX integration with Astrabit and are in the process of integrating up to 4 additional partners in the bot trading space


Our team is planning to build internal bot trading capabilities that layer onto partner applications


Incentives to trial new bot partnerships and automation will help drive more institutional and retail use of high volume generating strategies using our bots




350k for VLP Vault Rewards




Hyper VLP is a liquidity program that helped bootstrap our VLP vaults, but we intend on adding another layer for new liquidity


$ARB as well as $esVELA will be distributed to VLP vault providers that contribute and keep their USDC in the vaults over several epochs




Funding Address: arb1:0x678c29a2DA4Ae423457db591FF78bE8C9c63378C


Funding Address Characteristics: 2 out of 4 gnosis multisig with private keys securely stored


Contract Address: 0xDB15AA13d01834B114Bd57a115ec17330698fe5A (Op Lvl 3)


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives: DeFi ecosystems require an ongoing flow of new users, liquidity, and relevant feature sets in order to maintain relevance and to be sustainable. Vela Exchange is not only developing a trading platform that boasts advanced features like triggered orders and account abstraction, but also a social platform with achievements, gamification, and monetization potential.


Our aim is to:




Increase TVL, empowered by multichain deposits


Increase overall trading activity


Promote bot building onboarding incentives on Vela Exchange


Encourage ecosystem collaboration and power the technical frontier on Arbitrum




Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):


Success is measured by Unique Active Wallets (UAW), Total Volume, Total Value Locked (TVL), and the performance of our liquidity provider token, VLP. We also consider Google Analytics site performance, and the reach of our social communities and accounts in order to gauge our market share and interest.


Specifically for each initiative:


Multi-Chain / Fiat Onboarding: Overall multi-chain transfers, fiat transfers in volume


Socialfi: User retainment, trades per user, time in-app


Bot / Automated Trading: User onboarding into each bot partner, volume traded through bots


VLP Rewards: New VLP minted


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?:


We chose Arbitrum as our home because we viewed the network as a place where competition can thrive and projects constantly innovate to stay ahead of the curve.


Through the initial grant allocation, we will be able to aggressively pursue bringing new liquidity and traders from across the DeFi landscape. We also believe that pushing the frontiers of tech requires incentivization for participants to take the risk on the newest tech (like multi-chain collateral / LP minting).


The Vela Exchange has partnered with a growing number of highly regarded, powerhouse teams (including but not limited to Camelot, Seashell, Astrabit, Vaultka). We believe our collaborative nature and reliability makes us the perfect team to invest into for maximum network effect and growth for Arbitrum.


Justification for the size of the grant:


Vela Exchange has fostered substantial interest and growth on Arbitrum, which led to some of the largest trade volumes on the network to date. Our doxxed team is highly qualified and motivated to position the exchange amongst industry leaders in the perpetuals ecosystem, and we believe that our vision of creating the next generation of trading experiences on Arbitrum will increase the competitive atmosphere and push forward innovation.


Our vision is set and the requested grant will make our go-to-market more possible. Innovation and adoption requires a slight push for users to adopt the unknown or novel, and we believe that the allocation requested is perfect to get the ball rolling for some of the newest features at Vela Exchange.


Execution Strategy:


Our execution strategy will differ across the different feature / incentive allocations, generally following the schedule below:

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size
:

750K ARB (Siren)


Grant Matching
:

$10000 per month, denominated in Threshold Network Token (T), for a 12 month period, for a total of $120000.


Grant Breakdown
:

Bribes on Curve and Balancer via Hidden Hand (and potentially other relevant protocols), to incentivize rapid Bitcoin TVL growth on Arbitrum.


Funding Address
:

arb:0x6c2bd894bD166DCF053045a4883Db49EAE3FC01C


Funding Address Characteristics
:

Threshold Treasury Guild 5-of-9 multisig on Arbitrum.


Contract Address
:

arb:0x6c2bd894bD166DCF053045a4883Db49EAE3FC01C


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives
:

Aggressively grow the TVL of decentralized Bitcoin on Arbitrum, to make the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem more robust and less reliant on centralized WBTC.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
:

tBTC TVL (currently ~150 BTC) growth to 600 BTC, or $15M.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
:

A grant will enable us to incentivize tBTC pools on Arbitrum, via Hidden Hand and encourage tBTC TVL and volume growth on Arbitrum. In turn, this will make tBTC an attractive integration target for additional protocols (e.g. lending, derivatives, etc.).


Justification for the size of the grant
:

BTC is the largest crypto asset and most pristine collateral. Currently, the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem is excessively reliant on WBTC (~10,000 BTC TVL), of which the backing BTC is custodied by a central party. This exposes BTC DeFi on Arbitrum to significant counterparty risk.


A highly liquid, permissionless, censorship-resistant alternative will significantly benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem and reduce counterparty risk of BTC DeFi.


To attain this goal, this application is designed to support a long-term tBTC liquidity incentive program, and continue the growth of tBTC on Arbitrum.


The program will run for 12 months (T incentives persist after ARB is fully distributed), with a target to reach a tBTC TVL of 600 BTC.


Execution Strategy
:

Threshold DAO currently incentivizes the following Arbitrum pools via Warden protocol:






Balancer tBTC-WETH






Balancer WBTC-tBTC






Curve WBTC-tBTC curve(dot)fi/#/arbitrum/pools/factory-v2-98/deposit






Threshold DAO will migrate our Arbitrum bribe program to Hidden Hand, an Arbitrum native protocol. This will require ~$10k of T token to be bridged to Arbitrum per month, which is an opportunity to create a virtuous flywheel of T incentives driving further tBTC volume and adoption.


To capture this potential, we will create a T/tBTC pool on Arbitrum Balancer, as part of the incentives program.


ARB incentives will be allocated as follows:




~35% Balancer tBTC-WETH


~25% Balancer WBTC-tBTC


~25% Curve WBTC-tBTC


~15% Balancer 80T-20tBTC




The grant will be managed by the Threshold Treasury Guild’s Arbitrum multisig.


An Arbitrum grant will enable us to increase the incentives on those pools and potentially expand incentives to other protocols.


Grant Timeline
:

ARB incentives will be distributed linearly during the grant period, with a monthly distribution of 250000 ARB for a total of 750000 ARB.


Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?

Yes


SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?
:

No, although the tBTC contracts deployed on Arbitrum are native/canonical contracts, not wrapped variants.


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?
:

Ethereum, Base, Optimism, Polygon, Solana


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?
:

March 31, 2023 arbiscan(dot)io/tx/0x34004f22f4d206717368f941ddb7d389898240d86568f5bc71131136fd123f4a


Protocol Performance
:

TVL metrics: dune(dot)com/threshold/tbtc


Volume metrics: dune(dot)com/sensecapital/tbtc-liquidity


Bridge activity: tbtcscan(dot)com


Protocol Roadmap
:

tBTC is fully deployed and functional. Future enhancements may include:






Migrate to Schnorr signatures, using ROAST/FROST and GJKR RFC 10 (github(dot)com/keep-network/tbtc-v2/pull/601) to avoid the complexities of threshold ECDSA implementations.






Whitelist the canonical Arbitrum bridge to the tBTC minter contract (currently only Wormhole is whitelisted).






Native tBTC minting and redemption from Arbitrum

Audit History
:


Security is a top priority for us. We’ve taken a multi-faceted approach to ensure the safety of our platform. Our smart contracts undergo rigorous audits by reputable firms like Peckshield and WatchPug. We’ve opted for a proxy-based approach for our contracts. This method is designed to prevent unexpected issues from affecting the functioning of our platform. The upgrade permissions of our contracts are safeguarded by a timelock, which is controlled by a 3/5 multi-signature held by Equilibria’s core contributors, as well as members of Incuba Alpha Capital, GBV Capital, and Pendle Finance. Every upgrade undergoes extensive testing, auditing, and verification by the multi-signature signers. Once the upgrade is deemed secure, a 24-hour timelock is initiated. We’ve adopted this approach based on lessons learned from the crypto space, where unfortunate mistakes have led to serious consequences for projects. Our strategy ensures that upgrades are carefully considered and implemented.


We have undergone rigorous auditing by Peckshield and WatchPug:

SECTION 2: GRANT INFORMATION


Requested Grant Size
: 450,000 ARB (Siren Grants)


Grant Matching
:

Range does not have a token, making grant matching not possible at this time.


Grant Breakdown
:

100% of the requested funds will be directed to liquidity providers on Uniswap v3 (and other integrated AMMs) who deploy liquidity through Range Protocol vaults on Arbitrum. These incentives will be available until January 2024.


New vaults may be deployed on specific liquidity pools as necessary.


All operational costs associated with these new vaults, such as server costs, audits, development and analytical resources, gas costs, etc., will be covered by Range Protocol. No incentives will be allocated to the team.


An exact breakdown of which liquidity pairs will be incentivized, along with the corresponding amounts, will be updated at a later date, before the first bi-weekly update. We list our methodology for pool selection below under “Execution Strategy”

Contract Address
: Range will deploy new contracts for rewards distribution, which will also be available on our GitHub. The contract address will be updated here soon, before the first bi-weekly update.


SECTION 3: GRANT OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION


Objectives
:


We plan to use the grants for incentivizing LPs to provide narrow range liquidity on concentrated liquidity Dexes. This will directly benefit Arbitrum ecosystem in following ways :




Deeper liquidity depth for AMMs on Arbitrum, improving the trading experience for users by reducing slippage


Narrow range liquidity enables high levels of capital efficiency as most of the assets can be concentrated within a useful price range and idle liquidity across the AMM curve can be minimised. As a result, total useful liquidity should increase per unit of token invested.


Our JIT Rebalancing infrastructure can enable 10x more capital efficiency by combining the benefits of Concentrated liquidity AMMs and RFQ. Additional incentives can make retail users feel more confident in investing their idle assets through Range Protocol’s vaults. Active Strategy is explained in 
this medium post


Reduced capital requirements for project teams to bootstrap liquidity pools for their tokens and reduced selling pressure of inflationary tokenomics to support liquidity.




Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
:

Measurable KPIs as part of this grant will include:




Reduced slippage for swaps on pools with vaults deployed by Range


Increase TVL for the protocol


Increase in TVL on the AMM pools


Increased capital efficiency on these pools (Volume/TVL)




We will be tracking these KPIs and posting them in our updates here.


How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
:


Range protocol provides vaults for liquidity provisioning and most of this liquidity is deployed in narrow ranges for maximal capital efficiency and is very actively managed by automated strategies. The users providing their assets expect to have a positive yield from trading fees. But as with any narrow range liquidity provision, it comes with a risk of higher degree of impermanent loss.


So far, Range has been very selective about which liquidity pools to deploy vaults on with a simple expectation of


Expected Trading fees earned > Expected Impermanent Loss + rebalancing costs


We run backtests on the historical volatility of the trading pair and historical fees generated within particular price ranges to quantify our assumptions. The result is that not all token pairs can have a high confidence of profitability for LPs vs just holding the assets.


This is where the incentives will help. The incentives are primarily to offset Impermanent loss that users would otherwise experience and encourage more LPs to stake their assets in a capital-efficient way with lower risk. This should directly enable better and more efficient liquidity across Arbitrum network.


Justification for the size of the grant
:

We aim to maximize our impact on the Arbitrum network liquidity through this grant. Our goal is to attract liquidity from other networks and increase trading volumes directly. To achieve this, providing appropriate incentives is crucial. We believe that the requested grant amount is justified and is within the proposed budget limits.

100% of the grant amount is being directed towards retail users and the team does not benefit from it.


Execution Strategy
:


We understand there might be other incentive programs running concurrently making the decision to have rigid criteria for pools selection challenging during the application period. We have Gauntlet incentivising 6 pools on Uniswap and other liquidity managers and AMMs that will be giving out incentives from their budget as a part of this grant program. Having multiple teams incentivize the same pools defeats the purpose of what we are trying to achieve and it would just become a race of the liquidity migrating to whichever team gives out the highest incentives on those pools. For this reason, we request flexibility in deciding which pools to incentivize and providing this decision at a later date, no later than the 1st bi-weekly update. The complete list of contract addresses, pool addresses and amounts used will be updated here.


We list here our methodology for pool selection:




Prioritize liquidity pairs that have significantly better liquidity and trading volume on chains other than Arbitrum but the token is also integral across Arbitrum Defi ecosystem. ex LDO


Preference for tokens on Arbitrum that are used as collateral in money markets like Aave or have high volumes on perpetuals like GMX . e.g.: LINK/WETH


Critical and high volume pairs like ETH-USDC, ETH-USDT, USDC-USDT, wstETH-USDC, ETH-BTC, ARB-ETH


Avoid pools that are already over-incentivized from other project teams.


Pairs of tokens native to arbitrum like GMX




The incentives will run on vaults deployed on top of Uniswap v3. After the grant duration has ended, these vaults will continue to run and be actively managed in the absence of external incentives.

SECTION 4: PROTOCOL DETAILS


Is the Protocol Native to Arbitrum?

No, Range is deployed across multiple chains. As a relatively new protocol, we aim to establish a strong presence in ecosystems with significant DeFi activity. We consider Arbitrum to be one of the primary Layer 2 solutions for this purpose and are dedicated to bringing more exciting DeFi applications to Arbitrum


On what other networks is the protocol deployed?

Range is live on 6 networks: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, BSC, Mantle and Base.


What date did you deploy on Arbitrum?
:

We deployed on Arbitrum on 08 May 2023 (4.6 months ago) as seen from the 
Factory contract deployment


Protocol Performance
:


Range protocol went live in May 2023 and since then has been growing rapidly. To date, the TVL has grown to $13.2M. The protocol is live on 6 networks, across 5 different AMMs with 41 vault offerings. We are also able to close a funding round in a challenging market.


The capital efficiency of our strategies offered has been phenomenal. Within just 5 months, capital deposited by LPs through range has settled $480M in volume and growing fast. For some of these vaults, Range protocol managed positions have become the biggest % of the active liquidity of the pool. All of this while offering LPs an attractive yield based on only trading fees and 0 external incentives.


Depositors have accumulated $83K in fees so far.


All these strategies are being offered with 0% fee being charged on capital and a 2.5% fee on the trading fees earned which is quite negligible.


Range has 5 vaults live on Arbitrum and more coming within a couple of weeks. The total volume settled by liquidity on Range on Arbitrum is around $43M for last 30 days (extrapolating values here for vaults that have been live < 30 days)


On Ethereum, the wstETH-ETH vault is a good case study showing the capital efficiency of Range and how it can have an impact on the entire ecosystem.

Range deployed its wstETH vaults in May ‘23, starting with the 5bps fee pool and migrating to 1bps fee pool. This is currently the 5th highest volume pool on uniswap. Since then, Uniswap v3 has been consistently growing in market share for wstETH. Being among the largest active positions in this pool, range has had a significant impact on the migration and increase in the trading volumes. This vault currently has $2M in TVL but has settled $325M in volumes within the last 3 months.


Not only does this improve liquidity for the tokens, but the LPs are also able to enjoy an attractive return from trading fees, on top of what they already earn from validator yields.


Uniswap v3 consistently ranks among the most efficient AMM for  wstETH pool for a good reason. The trading volume naturally migrates to the AMM with the best liquidity depth around the current price and this growth has been completely organic without incentives until recently.


We aim to have a similar impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem and the grants would significantly help to boost the trading volumes and migrate liquidity and volumes to efficient venues.


Protocol Roadmap
:

Range protocol’s future roadmap is to grow in the Active Liquidity Management space but not be limited by it. We have a few new products lined up




Liquidity bootstrapping vaults for pegged assets, starting with GHO stablecoin. The team has also secured a grant from the Aave team to build this. This is currently in beta-testing phase and undergoing final audit with Veridise.


https://x.com/AaveGrants/status/1699485564662342021?s=20

This will be going live on mainnet soon and on Arbitrum when GHO becomes multichain on Arbitrum.


Apart from supporting multiple strategies over Uniswap v3, we will be soon adding support for Camelot and Trader Joe.


Cross-chain liquidity management vaults



The team is partnering up with a popular cross-chain protocol to manage liquidity across multiple L2s for multichain assets in an efficient way. This will be hugely beneficial to Arbitrum in solving the problem of fragmented liquidity. The implementation is currently in a proof of concept phase.








Apart from this, the team is continuously integrating with more AMMs and partnering with projects to launch new vaults. Our unique Just-in-Time rebalancing infrastructure provides efficiency of RFQs which enables us to scale up the vault TVL without being limited by low liquidity pools where rebalancing gets difficult.


Audit History
:

Range Protocol’s ALM vaults have undergone 2 audits from Halborn and Certik with no major findings and are ongoing follow-up audits with Veridise and Salusec.

Audit reports are 
available here


SECTION 5: Data and Reporting


Is your team prepared to create Dune Dashboards for your incentive program?

Yes, our team will be creating public Dune dashboards with detailed metrics including daily TVL, transactions, volumes and unique interactions for our vaults.

We plan to publish this before December and will update the link here.


Alongside this, we are also looking to publish a comparative analysis of liquidity across different AMM pools on Arbitrum vs Mainnet, how those change when incentivized and how providing liquidity in a capital efficient way on concentrated liquidity Dexes can naturally drive volume away from less captial efficient AMMs.


For some of the project token pools that we may incentivize, we will publish a customized liquidity analysis for their token.

Attaching a 
sample case study here


Does your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread?


Yes, we will be active in the forums and keep everyone updated on the progress. The updates will include TVL and liquidity changes that we observed along with updates on incentive distribution.


Does your team acknowledge that failure to comply with any of

the above requests can result in the halting of the program’s funding

stream?


Yes, we acknowledge this"
